Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In this issue of Nature Medicine, Thathiah et al.4 now provide provocative evidence that the adaptor protein β mediates the Abeta- altering effects of these GPCRs by promoting Abeta generation. This newly uncovered function of β-arrestin 2 suggests it could be targeted to decrease amyloid pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Production of the amyloid-β peptide in Alzheimer's disease by the γ-secretase complex can be regulated by certain G proteinâ€“coupled receptors. This regulation seems to be mediated by β-arrestin-2, whose expression was found to be elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains.Recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to a GPCR leads to interaction with the γ-secretase complex via the Aph-1 subunit. Other members of the complex include presenilin-1 (PS-1), nicastrin (Nct) and Pen-2. The complex then moves laterally into lipid rafts, where γ-secretase activation is enhanced. Internalization may also occur to localize γ-secretase to late endosomes, where its activation is also increased. Cleavage of APP by β-secretase (BACE1) to release soluble APP (sAPPb) followed by γ-secretase produces Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Increased production and secretion of Abeta from cells can lead to extracellular Abeta aggregation in the form of plaques. Mutagenesis of GPR3 in regions of the protein that specifically interact with either G protein or β-arrestin 2 further showed that β-arrestin 2, not G protein, mediates the ability of GPR3 to increase Abeta levels.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The interaction of APP with APP-BP1 activates a pathway leading to the conjugation of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to its target (Fig. 1, ref. 44). APP-BP1, together with hUba3, is functionally analogous to the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, with hUba3 containing the active cysteine and ATP binding site. When NEDD8 is activated by the APP- BP1/hUba3 complex, it forms a thiol ester bond with hUbc12, which has a function parallel to that of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc32. Subsequently, NEDD8 is covalently coupled to lysine residues in its target proteins (46). So far, the proteins known to be neddylated via this pathway are a family of proteins called cullins (47) and the Mdm2 oncogene product, which in turn regulates neddylation of the cell cycle protein p53. Cullins are scaffold proteins for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and neddylation of cullin enhances its ability to promote ubiquitination (49,50). Indeed, NEDD8 has been found in ubiquitinated neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain (51). NEDD8 signalling has been shown to regulate protein degradation pathways participating in cell cycle progression (52â€“55). The discovery of a novel protein, NUB1, which recruits NEDD8-conjugates to the proteasome for degradation, provides a direct link between these 2 systems (56,57). Inhibition of the neddylation pathway in neurons by expression of a dominant negative mutant of hUbc12 prevents FAD APP- mediated cell cycle entry and apoptotic process (44,45). Thus, elements of this pathway are attractive targets for potential therapies aimed at preventing neurons in AD brain from entering the cell cycle.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events.

Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder (Gab) proteins are intracellular scaffolding/docking molecules, and participate in multiple signaling pathways, usually acting as the downstream effector of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)-triggered signal transduction pathway. When phosphorylated by PTKs, Gab proteins can recruit several signaling molecules (p85, SHP2, and Crk), and subsequently activate multiple transmitting signals that are critical for cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptotic process. Recently, it has been reported that Gab2 polymorphism is associated with the increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Assemblies of Abeta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Abeta- secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. The generation of Abeta is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Abeta. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate gamma-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We report that infection of human primary neural cells with a high phenotypic reactivator HSV-1 (17syn+) induces upregulation of a brain- enriched microRNA (miRNA)-146a that is associated with proinflammatory signaling in stressed brain cells and Alzheimer's disease. Expression of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, the inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2, and the neuroinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta were each upregulated. A known miRNA-146a target in the brain, complement factor H, was downregulated. These data suggest a role for HSV-1-induced miRNA-146a in the evasion of HSV-1 from the complement system, and the activation of key elements of the arachidonic acid cascade known to contribute to Alzheimer-type neuropathological change.

LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content.

Indeed, miR-485-5p and BACE1-antisense compete for binding within the same region in the open reading frame of the BACE1 mRNA. We observed opposing effects of BACE1-antisense and miR-485-5p on BACE1 protein in vitro and showed that Locked Nucleic Acid-antimiR mediated knockdown of miR-485-5p as well as BACE1-antisense over-expression can prevent the miRNA-induced BACE1 suppression.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The role of miR-124 on the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an important cleavager of amyloid precursor protein that plays a pivotal role in the β-amyloid production, was studied in this paper using cellular models for Alzheimer' disease (AD) of cultured PC12 cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Inheritance of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the only confirmed and consistently replicated risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE is also a key ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), a major neuronal low-density lipoprotein receptor. ApoE and LRP mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the postmortem inferior temporal gyrus (area 20) and the hippocampus from individuals with dementia compared with those with intact cognition. In addition to their strong association with the progression of cognitive dysfunction, LRP and ApoE mRNA levels were also positively correlated with increasing neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Additionally, Western blot analysis of ApoE protein expression in the hippocampus showed that the differential expression observed at the transcriptional level is also reflected at the protein level. Given the critical role played by LRP and ApoE in amyloid beta (Abeta) and cholesterol trafficking, increased expression of LRP and ApoE may not only disrupt cholesterol homeostasis but may also contribute to some of the neurobiological features of AD, including plaque deposition.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The γ-secretase complex comprises presenilins (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. Herein, we find that PEN-2 can interact with ferritin light chain (FTL), an important component of the iron storage protein ferritin. In addition, we show that overexpression of FTL increases the protein levels of PEN-2 and PS1 amino-terminal fragment (NTF) and promotes γ-secretase activity for more production of Abeta and notch intracellular domain (NICD). Furthermore, iron treatments increase the levels of FTL, PEN-2 and PS1 NTF and promote γ-secretase- mediated NICD production. Moreover, downregulation of FTL decreases the levels of PEN-2 and PS1 NTF. Together, our results suggest that iron can increase γ-secretase activity through promoting the level of FTL that interacts with and stabilizes PEN-2, providing a new molecular link between iron, PEN-2/γ-secretase and Abeta generation in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	integrins play important roles in neurite development, neuronal migration, and synapse functions.

After removal of anyof these components (Reelin, receptors, or Disabled-1), cortical layer formation is severely disrupted, leading to the model that these interactions are important for laminar organization in development.In synapses, Reelin promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits (e.g., NR2A) and facilitates LTP.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Iron was further demonstrated to modulate expression of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor holo-protein (APP) by a mechanism similar to that of regulation of ferritin-L and -H mRNA translation through an iron-responsive element (IRE) in their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Here, we discuss two aspects of the link between iron and AD, in relation to the recently discovered IRE in the 5'UTR of APP mRNA. The first is the physiological aspect: a compensatory neuroprotective response of amyloid-ÃƒÅ¸ protein (ABeta¸) in reducing iron-induced neurotoxicity. Thus, given that ABeta¸ possesses iron chelation sites, it is hypothesized that OS-induced intracellular iron may stimulate APP holo-protein translation (via the APP 5'UTR) and subsequently the generation of its cleavage product, ABeta¸, as a compensatory response that eventually reduces OS.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	ABeta¸PP cytodomain also interacts with other proteins directly linked to signal transduction mechanisms. In particular, ABeta¸PP binds to the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Go [60Ã¢â‚¬â€œ63] that comprises up to 1% of all membrane-associated proteins in the developing nervous system [55]. There is evidence that ABeta¸PP cytodomain binds proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation such as ABeta¸PP-binding protein 1 (APP-BP1) [64] and p-21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3) [65] which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in DNA synthesis and neuronal apoptotic process. These data are consistent with a model in which ABeta¸PP is a component of a Go multiprotein complex, including PAK3, to transduce extracellular signals to the cytoplasm. In this model, the FAD APP-mediated pathway, leading to tentative neuronal cell-cycle activation (see below), consists of the APP-Go-PAK3 formation, followed by the activation of the ABeta¸PP-BP1 through JNK	GNAI1	APP	Florio T	"p(HGNC:""GNAI1"")"	22496686.0	increases	"p(HGNC:""APP"")"	Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease: role of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 intracellular signaling.

In addition, as revealed by Western blot, small interfering RNA and immunofluorescence analysis, S100B-induced JNK activation increased expression of Dickopff-1 that, in turn, promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin degradation, causing canonical Wnt signaling pathway disruption and tau protein hyperphosphorylation.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The secreted protein, YKL-40, has been proposed as a biomarker of a variety of human diseases characterized by ongoing inflammation, including chronic neurologic pathologies such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. However, inflammatory mediators and the molecular mechanism responsible for enhanced expression of YKL-40 remained elusive. Using several mouse models of inflammation, we now show that YKL-40 expression correlated with increased expression of both IL-1 and IL-6. Furthermore, IL-1 together with IL-6 or the IL-6 family cytokine, oncostatin M, synergistically upregulated YKL-40 expression in both primary human and mouse astrocytes in vitro. The robust cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes required both STAT3 and NF-kB binding elements of the YKL-40 promoter. In addition, YKL-40 expression was enhanced by constitutively active STAT3 and inhibited by dominant-negative IkBalpha. Surprisingly, cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes was independent of the p65 subunit of NF-kB and instead required subunits RelB and p50. Mechanistically, we show that IL-1-induced RelB/p50 complex formation was further promoted by oncostatin M and that these complexes directly bound to the YKL-40 promoter. Moreover, we found that expression of RelB was strongly upregulated during inflammation in vivo and by IL-1 in astrocytes in vitro. We propose that IL-1 and the IL-6 family of cytokines regulate YKL-40 expression during sterile inflammation via both STAT3 and RelB/p50 complexes. These results suggest that IL-1 may regulate the expression of specific anti-inflammatory genes in nonlymphoid tissues via the canonical activation of the RelB/p50 complexes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The p53-family member TAp73 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in many biological processes. Here, we show that p73 drives the expression of microRNA (miR)-34a, but not miR-34b and -c, by acting on specific binding sites on the miR-34a promoter. Expression of miR-34a is modulated in parallel with that of TAp73 during in vitro differentiation of neuroblastoma cells and cortical neurons. Retinoid- driven neuroblastoma differentiation is inhibited by knockdown of either p73 or miR-34a. Transcript expression of miR-34a is significantly reduced in vivo both in the cortex and hippocampus of p73(-/-) mice; miR-34a and TAp73 expression also increase during postnatal development of the brain and cerebellum when synaptogenesis occurs. Accordingly, overexpression or silencing of miR-34a inversely modulates expression of synaptic targets, including synaptotagmin-1 and syntaxin-1A. Notably, the axis TAp73/miR-34a/synaptotagmin-1 is conserved in brains from Alzheimer's patients. These data reinforce a role for TAp73 in neuronal development.

Also there are studies suggesting the link of this TREM2 variant with certain clinical and neuroimaging AD features such as frontobasal gray atrophy. Moreover, in disease brain TREM2 forms complex with TYROBP which triggers immune responses through activating macrophages and dendritic cells which leads to chronic neuroinflammation.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Neurodegenerative tauopathies characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau include frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing tau levels improves cognitive function in mouse models of AD and FTDP-17, but the mechanisms regulating the turnover of pathogenic tau are unknown. We found that tau is acetylated and that tau acetylation prevents degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Using two antibodies specific for acetylated tau, we showed that tau acetylation is elevated in patients at early and moderate Braak stages of tauopathy. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was involved in tau acetylation and the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 in deacetylation. Deleting SIRT1 enhanced levels of acetylated-tau and pathogenic forms of p-tau in vivo, likely by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibiting p300 with a small molecule promoted tau deacetylation and eliminated p-tau associated with tauopathy. Modulating tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic strategy to reduce tau-mediated neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Recent data have demonstrated that AbetaPP may signal to the nucleus also using a Abeta-secretase-independent mechanism that involves membrane sequestration and phosphorylation of Tip60.More recently, Stante et al. have suggested that the presence of Fe65 into the nucleus may have a protective role, and that its translocation depends on AbetaPP. They propose that DNA repair defects could significantly contribute to the neurodysfunction and neurodegeneration observed in AD, and that an involvement of the Fe65-APP complex in the response of the cells to DNA damage and in the DNA repair machinery could represent a possible mechanism contributing to neuronal degeneration observed in AD pathology	KAT5	APP	Florio T	"p(HGNC:""KAT5"",pmod(Ph))"	22496686.0	increases	"p(HGNC:""APP"")"	Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease: role of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 intracellular signaling.

Subsequently, APP accumulates in the ER and is processed into Abeta that induces hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (ptau).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and a central player in glucose and lipid metabolism, is potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AMPK activity decreases in AD brain, indicating decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In SHSY5Y cells, a human neuroblastom a cell line, as well as in primary cultu res of rat cortical neurons insulin ad ministrat ion leads to tau hyperphosphorylation (111-113]. In contrast, insulin and IGF- 1 administration in NT2N cells, cultured human neurons, decreases tau phosphorylat ion [114]. In primary cortical n euron cultures, M esk e et a/ .

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Insulin and insulin receptors were shown to decrease in a normal brain with aging, but increase in AD brains [29]. Several basic science studies have explored and shown the relationship between the increased insulin and AD pathology in the aspects other than Abeta degradation alone. For example, insulin increases the secretion of Abeta into extracellular space [31], stimulates tau phosphorylation to form neurofibrillary tangles, and impairs insulin signal transduction [32] and [40] (reviewed by Gasparini and Hoyer). Insulin also affected APP processing in vivo, a critical molecular step in generating Abeta, to secrete sAPP [13], [16] and [81]. In addition, Abeta reduces insulin binding to insulin receptors [95].

Among the AD- related miRNA expression changes, miR-107 was exceptional because miR-107 levels decreased significantly even in patients with the earliest stages of pathology. In situ hybridization with cross- comparison to neuropathology demonstrated that particular cerebral cortical laminas involved by AD pathology exhibit diminished neuronal miR-107 expression.

Expression of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, the inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2, and the neuroinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta were each upregulated.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The oxidized LDL receptor 1 gene (OLR1) rs1050283 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been previously shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An association analysis of OLR1 was carried out in a population of 443 patients with AD as compared with 393 age- matched controls. In addition, an expression analysis of OLR1 and its regulatory hsa-miR369-3p was performed in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from 20 patients and 15 controls. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for gender and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, showed a statistically significant association of OLR1 rs1050283 under the assumption of a dominant model (CC and CT individuals versus TT: p = 0.014, OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.08-2.08) and a genotypic model (TC versus TT: p = 0.002, OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.14-2.26). No significant differences in OLR1 expression was observed between patients and controls (p > 0.05). However, stratifying patients according to the rs1050283 status, significantly decreased relative PBMC expression levels of OLR1 were observed in carriers of CC+CT genotypes as compared with TT carriers (0.13 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â± 0.013 versus 0.46 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 0.028, p = 0.022), whereas no differences in relative expression levels of the hsa-miR369-3p were observed (p > 0.05). The effect observed was not due to the presence of the ApoE ε4 allele. The OLR1 rs1050283 SNP likely acts as a risk factor for sporadic AD. The presence of at least one C allele is associated with a decreased expression of OLR1 mRNA in the absence of hsa-miR369-3p de-regulation, suggesting that the presence of the polymorphic allele influences the binding of hsa- miR369-3p to its 3'UTR consensus sequence. Nevertheless, the limited power of the study requires further investigations with a larger sample size.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The role of miR-124 on the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an important cleavager of amyloid precursor protein that plays a pivotal role in the β-amyloid production, was studied in this paper using cellular models for Alzheimer' disease (AD) of cultured PC12 cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Expression profiling of 200 microRNAs in human monocytes revealed that several of them (miR-146a/b, miR-132, and miR-155) are endotoxin- responsive genes. Analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial components and proinflammatory cytokines. By means of promoter analysis, miR-146a was found to be a NF-kappaB-dependent gene. Importantly, miR-146a/b were predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3' UTRs of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and IL-1 receptor- associated kinase 1 genes, and we found that these UTRs inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene. These genes encode two key adapter molecules downstream of Toll-like and cytokine receptors. Thus, we propose a role for miR-146 in control of Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling through a negative feedback regulation loop involving down-regulation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 protein levels.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events.

When phosphorylated by PTKs, Gab proteins can recruit several signaling molecules (p85, SHP2, and Crk), and subsequently activate multiple transmitting signals that are critical for cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptotic process. Recently, it has been reported that Gab2 polymorphism is associated with the increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Many ABeta¸ has a physiological role in normal synapse function. In organotypic hippocampal slices, BACE activity is increased by synaptic activity and the resulting ABeta¸ peptides depress excitatory transmission through a-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, suggesting a role for ABeta¸ in homeostatic plasticity [29].

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	integrins play important roles in neurite development, neuronal migration, and synapse functions. Several studies show that Reelin signaling has an important role in neuronal migration through its interaction with ApoE receptor 2 and the VLDL receptor, and the subsequent phosphorylation of Disabled-1. After removal of anyof these components (Reelin, receptors, or Disabled-1), cortical layer formation is severely disrupted, leading to the model that these interactions are important for laminar organization in development.In synapses, Reelin promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits (e.g., NR2A) and facilitates LTP. Reelin signaling has an important role in NMDA and AMPA receptor function, maturation of glutamatergic synapses.ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin facilitates reorganization of actin filaments and affects neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. The Reelin-a3ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin interaction regulates neuronal migration, perhaps by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton, or by stabilizing the cytoskeleton through n-cofilin phosphorylation. Integrins also regulate synaptic glutamate receptor function, synaptic plasticity, working memory, and LTP. The APP-ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin interaction is also important in neurite outgrowth. We suggest that the functions of Reelin and ÃƒÅ¸1 integrins on these processes may be modulated by APP (or other APP family members).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because APP is processed into the beta- peptide that accumulates in amyloid plaques, and APP gene mutations can cause early onset AD. Inflammation is also associated with AD as exemplified by increased expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in microglia in affected areas of the AD brain. Here we demonstrate that IL-1alpha and IL-1beta increase APP synthesis by up to 6-fold in primary human astrocytes and by 15-fold in human astrocytoma cells without changing the steady-state levels of APP mRNA. A 90-nucleotide sequence in the APP gene 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) conferred translational regulation by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Steady-state levels of transfected APP(5'-UTR)/CAT mRNAs were unchanged, whereas both base-line and IL-1-dependent CAT protein synthesis were increased. This APP mRNA translational enhancer maps from +55 to +144 nucleotides from the 5'-cap site and is homologous to related translational control elements in the 5'-UTR of the light and and heavy ferritin genes. Enhanced translation of APP mRNA provides a mechanism by which IL-1 influences the pathogenesis of AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand. Our results suggest a central role for sHsps in the neuroinflammatory reaction in AD and CAA and thus in contributing to cognitive decline.

Recently, it has been reported that anti-Abeta autoantibodies were progressively reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with CAA-related inflammation, following intravenous steroid administration (Piazza et al., 2013). Reduction of S100A9/Mrp14 might induce suppression of amyloid fibril formation (Zhang et al., 2012) and increase phagocytosis of fibrillar Abeta in microglia cells (Kummer et al., 2012), resulting in reduced Abeta amyloid fibril deposition.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Background and Objective: Could a normal - but persistent - stress response to impeded axonal transport lead to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-Abeta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and a central player in glucose and lipid metabolism, is potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AMPK activity decreases in AD brain, indicating decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The role of miR-124 on the expression of Abeta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an important cleavager of amyloid precursor protein that plays a pivotal role in the Abeta-amyloid production, was studied in this paper using cellular models for Alzheimer' disease (AD) of cultured PC12 cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	It is believed that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the process of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage is a key event and has raised much attention in the field of AD research. It is proposed that APP, beta- and gamma-secretases are all located on the lipid raft, and the meeting of them is an indispensable step for Abeta generation. Endocytosis can lead to clustering of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases from separate smaller lipid rafts into a larger one. On the other hand, for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or interaction with Ca(2+) can lead to its release from membrane into cytoplasm. This process induces the release of actins and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which are important factors for endocytosis. Thus, the present review proposes that MARCKS may be implicated in Abeta generation, by modulating free PIP2 level and actin movement, causing endocytosis	APP	MARCKS	Zhang YL	"p(HGNC:""APP"",frag(""672_713""))"	20651816.0	increases	"p(HGNC:""MARCKS"")"	A possible role of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate in endocytic pathway of Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder (Gab) proteins are intracellular scaffolding/docking molecules, and participate in multiple signaling pathways, usually acting as the downstream effector of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)-triggered signal transduction pathway. When phosphorylated by PTKs, Gab proteins can recruit several signaling molecules (p85, SHP2, and Crk), and subsequently activate multiple transmitting signals that are critical for cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptotic process.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Assemblies of Abeta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Abeta- secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. The generation of Abeta is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Abeta. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate gamma-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here we provide evidence in human neural (HN) cells of an aluminum- sulfate- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated up-regulation of an NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a that down-regulates the expression of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of inflammation. This NF-kappaB-miRNA-146a-CFH signaling circuit is known to be similarly affected by Abeta42 peptides and in AD brain. These aluminum-sulfate-inducible events were not observed in parallel experiments using iron-, magnesium-, or zinc-sulfate-stressed HN cells. An NF-kappaB-containing miRNA-146a-promoter-luciferase reporter construct transfected into HN cells showed significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a after aluminum-sulfate treatment that corresponded to decreased CFH gene expression. These data suggest that (1) as in AD brain, NF-kappaB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated, modulation of CFH gene expression may contribute to inflammatory responses in aluminum- stressed HN cells, and (2) underscores the potential of nanomolar aluminum to drive genotoxic mechanisms characteristic of neurodegenerative disease processes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6.

In macrophages PPARγ represses inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase induction as well as concomitant NO production (11) and attenuates the oxidative burst (13, 14). Moreover, inhibiting nuclear factor ÎºB (NFÎºB) decreases expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) or IL-6 (12).

However, we found significant down-regulation of miR-29a in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. The database search on TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase Target identified neurone navigator 3 (NAV3), a regulator of axon guidance, as a principal target of miR-29a, and actually NAV3 mRNA levels were elevated in AD brains. MiR-29a-mediated down-regulation of NAV3 was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. By immunohistochemistry, NAV3 expression was most evidently enhanced in degenerating pyramidal neurones in the cerebral cortex of AD. These observations suggest the hypothesis that underexpression of miR-29a affects neurodegenerative processes by enhancing neuronal NAV3 expression in AD brains.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Type III RNase Dicer is responsible for the maturation and function of microRNA (miRNA) molecules in the cell. It is now well-documented that Dicer and the fine-tuning of the miRNA gene network are important for neuronal integrity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in neuronal death, particularly in the adult brain, remain poorly defined. Here we show that the absence of Dicer in the adult forebrain is accompanied by a mixed neurodegenerative phenotype. Although neuronal loss is observed in the hippocampus, cellular shrinkage is predominant in the cortex. Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology. Transcriptome analysis of enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation identified ERK1 as one of the candidate kinases responsible for this event in vivo. We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo. Finally, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. In summary, these results support the hypothesis that changes in the miRNA network may contribute to a neurodegenerative phenotype by affecting tau phosphorylation.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing. Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects β-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The oxidized LDL receptor 1 gene (OLR1) rs1050283 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been previously shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An association analysis of OLR1 was carried out in a population of 443 patients with AD as compared with 393 age- matched controls. In addition, an expression analysis of OLR1 and its regulatory hsa-miR369-3p was performed in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from 20 patients and 15 controls. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for gender and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, showed a statistically significant association of OLR1 rs1050283 under the assumption of a dominant model (CC and CT individuals versus TT: p = 0.014, OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.08-2.08) and a genotypic model (TC versus TT: p = 0.002, OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.14-2.26). No significant differences in OLR1 expression was observed between patients and controls (p > 0.05). However, stratifying patients according to the rs1050283 status, significantly decreased relative PBMC expression levels of OLR1 were observed in carriers of CC+CT genotypes as compared with TT carriers (0.13 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â± 0.013 versus 0.46 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 0.028, p = 0.022), whereas no differences in relative expression levels of the hsa-miR369-3p were observed (p > 0.05). The effect observed was not due to the presence of the ApoE ε4 allele. The OLR1 rs1050283 SNP likely acts as a risk factor for sporadic AD. The presence of at least one C allele is associated with a decreased expression of OLR1 mRNA in the absence of hsa-miR369-3p de-regulation, suggesting that the presence of the polymorphic allele influences the binding of hsa- miR369-3p to its 3'UTR consensus sequence. Nevertheless, the limited power of the study requires further investigations with a larger sample size.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid β-peptide (Abeta) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abnormal regulation of tau phosphorylation and/or alternative splicing is associated with the development of a large (>20) group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer's disease. Despite intensive research, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that participate in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of endogenous tau, especially in neurons. We identified miR-16 and miR-132 as putative endogenous modulators of neuronal tau phosphorylation and tau exon 10 splicing, respectively. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been implicated in cell survival and function, whereas changes in miR-16/132 levels correlate with tau pathology in human neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, understanding how miRNA networks influence tau metabolism and possibly other biological systems might provide important clues into the molecular causes of tauopathies, particularly the more common but less understood sporadic forms.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The γ-secretase complex comprises presenilins (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. Herein, we find that PEN-2 can interact with ferritin light chain (FTL), an important component of the iron storage protein ferritin. In addition, we show that overexpression of FTL increases the protein levels of PEN-2 and PS1 amino-terminal fragment (NTF) and promotes γ-secretase activity for more production of Abeta and notch intracellular domain (NICD). Furthermore, iron treatments increase the levels of FTL, PEN-2 and PS1 NTF and promote γ-secretase- mediated NICD production. Moreover, downregulation of FTL decreases the levels of PEN-2 and PS1 NTF. Together, our results suggest that iron can increase γ-secretase activity through promoting the level of FTL that interacts with and stabilizes PEN-2, providing a new molecular link between iron, PEN-2/γ-secretase and Abeta generation in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid β (Abeta) aggregates are the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient's brain. Abeta is known to bind p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and mediates Abeta-induced neuronal death. Recently, we showed that NGF leads to p75(NTR) polyubiquitination, which promotes neuronal cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that Abeta stimulation impaired the p75(NTR) polyubiquitination. TRAF6 and p62 are required for polyubiquitination of p75(NTR) on NGF stimulation. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of TRAF6/p62 restored p75(NTR) polyubiquitination upon Abeta/NGF treatment. Abeta significantly reduced NF-ÎºB activity by attenuating the interaction of p75(NTR) with IKKβ. p75(NTR) increased NF-ÎºB activity by recruiting TRAF6/p62, which thereby mediated cell survival. These findings indicate that TRAF6/p62 abrogated the Abeta- mediated inhibition of p75(NTR) polyubiquitination and restored neuronal cell survival.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Dyrk1A phosphorylates several transcription factors, including NFAT and CREB and a number of cytosolic proteins such as APP, tau, and a-synuclein. Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder (Gab) proteins are intracellular scaffolding/docking molecules, and participate in multiple signaling pathways, usually acting as the downstream effector of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)-triggered signal transduction pathway. When phosphorylated by PTKs, Gab proteins can recruit several signaling molecules (p85, SHP2, and Crk), and subsequently activate multiple transmitting signals that are critical for cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptotic process. Recently, it has been reported that Gab2 polymorphism is associated with the increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABeta¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF- receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABeta¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃƒÅ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃƒÅ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The extracellular domain of APP interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein F-spondin. F-spondin also interacts with members of the LDL receptor family.Reelin is another large, multi-domain, extracellular protein that interacts with members of the LDL receptor family.Reelin affects neurite outgrowth in vitro and regulates neuronal migration in development via phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Disabled (Dab-1). Dab-1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of the proteins in the LDL receptor and APP families.Another important class of molecules involved in neurite outgrowth, cell adhesion, and cell migration is the family of integrins.Integrins are transmembrane proteins that form the link between the ECM and intracellular components. APP interacts and colocalizes with ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin, a molecule that is important for proper laminar organization and capable of enhancing neurite outgrowth. ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin interacts with Reelin, and this interaction is important for its effects on neuronal migration.we observed that interactions between Reelin, APP, and a3ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin promote neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons and that APP and Reelin affected dendritic processes in vivo.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol- response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR- inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism.

Gakhar-Koppole et al. (2008) and Rohe et al. (2008) also reported that APPs stimulated neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth, but suggested that it is mediated through enhanced ERK phosphorylation and may be dependent on membrane-bound APP. Han et al. (2005) offered yet a different mechanism that the growth promoting property is mediated by the ability of APPsa to down-regulate CDK5 and inhibit t hyperphosphorylation.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Interestingly, we found that APP also affects excitatory synaptic transmission by altering AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) trafficking. Recently, we demonstrated that APP increases cell surface levels of the GluA2 (or GluR2) subunit of AMPA receptors (or GluAs), but does not alter levels of GluA1 (or GluR1), suggesting that APP regulates certain AMPAR subunits, specifically GluA2. Considering that alterations in AMPAR subunit expression (particularly in the synaptic content of GluA2-containing AMPARs) can impact synaptic transmission and plasticity, these changes may also potentially alter the function of excitatory synapses. The increase in GluA2 levels is expected to enhance excitatory synaptic transmission, especially because it occurred in the absence of a decrease in GluA1, suggesting an overall increase in AMPAR number at synapses.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because APP is processed into the beta- peptide that accumulates in amyloid plaques, and APP gene mutations can cause early onset AD. Inflammation is also associated with AD as exemplified by increased expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in microglia in affected areas of the AD brain. Here we demonstrate that IL-1alpha and IL-1beta increase APP synthesis by up to 6-fold in primary human astrocytes and by 15-fold in human astrocytoma cells without changing the steady-state levels of APP mRNA. A 90-nucleotide sequence in the APP gene 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) conferred translational regulation by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Steady-state levels of transfected APP(5'-UTR)/CAT mRNAs were unchanged, whereas both base-line and IL-1-dependent CAT protein synthesis were increased. This APP mRNA translational enhancer maps from +55 to +144 nucleotides from the 5'-cap site and is homologous to related translational control elements in the 5'-UTR of the light and and heavy ferritin genes. Enhanced translation of APP mRNA provides a mechanism by which IL-1 influences the pathogenesis of AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand. Our results suggest a central role for sHsps in the neuroinflammatory reaction in AD and CAA and thus in contributing to cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Glial activation and increased inflammation characterize neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim was to develop a model for studying phagocytosis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide by human microglia and to test effects thereupon by immunomodulatory substances. Human CHME3 microglia showed intracellular Abeta(1-42) colocalized with lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, indicating phagocytosis. This was increased by interferon-gamma, and to a lesser degree with Protollin, a proteosome-based adjuvant. Secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was decreased by Abeta(1-42) and by interferon-gamma and interleukin-1beta. These cytokines, but not Abeta(1-42), stimulated interleukin-6 release. Microglia which phagocytosed Abeta(1-42) exhibited a higher degree of expression of interleukin-1 receptor type I and inducible nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, we show that human microglia are able to phagocytose Abeta(1-42) and that this is associated with expression of inflammatory markers. Abeta(1-42) and interferon-gamma decreased BDNF secretion suggesting a new neuropathological role for Abeta(1-42) and the inflammation accompanying AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In this issue of Nature Medicine, Thathiah et al.4 now provide provocative evidence that the adaptor protein β mediates the Abeta- altering effects of these GPCRs by promoting Abeta generation. This newly uncovered function of β-arrestin 2 suggests it could be targeted to decrease amyloid pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Production of the amyloid-β peptide in Alzheimer's disease by the γ-secretase complex can be regulated by certain G proteinâ€“coupled receptors. This regulation seems to be mediated by β-arrestin-2, whose expression was found to be elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains.Recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to a GPCR leads to interaction with the γ-secretase complex via the Aph-1 subunit. Other members of the complex include presenilin-1 (PS-1), nicastrin (Nct) and Pen-2. The complex then moves laterally into lipid rafts, where γ-secretase activation is enhanced. Internalization may also occur to localize γ-secretase to late endosomes, where its activation is also increased. Cleavage of APP by β-secretase (BACE1) to release soluble APP (sAPPb) followed by γ-secretase produces Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Increased production and secretion of Abeta from cells can lead to extracellular Abeta aggregation in the form of plaques. Mutagenesis of GPR3 in regions of the protein that specifically interact with either G protein or β-arrestin 2 further showed that β-arrestin 2, not G protein, mediates the ability of GPR3 to increase Abeta levels.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a protective mechanism against ER stress in which unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER are selectively transported to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We cloned the novel ubiquitin ligase HRD1, which is involved in ERAD, and showed that HRD1 promoted amyloid precursor protein (APP) ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of amyloid Abeta (Abeta). In addition, suppression of HRD1 expression caused APP accumulation and promoted Abeta generation associated with ER stress and apoptotic process. Interestingly, HRD1 levels were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the brains of these patients experienced ER stress. Our recent study revealed that this decrease in HRD1 was due to its insolubilization; however, controversy persists about whether the decrease in HRD1 protein promotes Abeta generation or whether Abeta neurotoxicity causes the decrease in HRD1 protein levels. Here, we review current findings on the mechanism of HRD1 protein loss in the AD brain and the involvement of HRD1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, we propose that HRD1 may be a target for novel AD therapeutics.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques of amyloid-Abeta (Abeta) peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3Abeta (GSK3Abeta) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3Abeta to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3Abeta activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3Abeta, or at Thr-668, the GSK3Abeta phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3Abeta activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3Abeta kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The interaction of APP with APP-BP1 activates a pathway leading to the conjugation of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to its target (Fig. 1, ref. 44). APP-BP1, together with hUba3, is functionally analogous to the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, with hUba3 containing the active cysteine and ATP binding site. When NEDD8 is activated by the APP- BP1/hUba3 complex, it forms a thiol ester bond with hUbc12, which has a function parallel to that of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc32. Subsequently, NEDD8 is covalently coupled to lysine residues in its target proteins (46). So far, the proteins known to be neddylated via this pathway are a family of proteins called cullins (47) and the Mdm2 oncogene product, which in turn regulates neddylation of the cell cycle protein p53. Cullins are scaffold proteins for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and neddylation of cullin enhances its ability to promote ubiquitination (49,50). Indeed, NEDD8 has been found in ubiquitinated neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain (51). NEDD8 signalling has been shown to regulate protein degradation pathways participating in cell cycle progression (52â€“55). The discovery of a novel protein, NUB1, which recruits NEDD8-conjugates to the proteasome for degradation, provides a direct link between these 2 systems (56,57). Inhibition of the neddylation pathway in neurons by expression of a dominant negative mutant of hUbc12 prevents FAD APP- mediated cell cycle entry and apoptotic process (44,45). Thus, elements of this pathway are attractive targets for potential therapies aimed at preventing neurons in AD brain from entering the cell cycle.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and a central player in glucose and lipid metabolism, is potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AMPK activity decreases in AD brain, indicating decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Dyrk1A activity is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (Dierssen and de Lagran, 2006). For example, while Ras-dependent signaling is required for promoting or maintaining neuronal differentiation, Dyrk1A modulates ERK activation by interacting with Ras, B-Raf, and MEK1 and by facilitating the formation of a Ras/B-Raf/MEK1 multi-protein complex (Kelly and Rahmani, 2005). Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau. Furthermore, these cells show a marked increase of apoptotic cell death (Park et al., 2007), indicating that the overexpression of Dyrk1A induces cell death	APP	DYRK1A	Chung KC	"p(HGNC:""APP"",pmod(Ph))"	22110360.0	increases	"p(HGNC:""DYRK1A"")"	Dyrk1A Positively Stimulates ASK1-JNK Signaling Pathway during Apoptotic Cell Death.
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder (Gab) proteins are intracellular scaffolding/docking molecules, and participate in multiple signaling pathways, usually acting as the downstream effector of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)-triggered signal transduction pathway. When phosphorylated by PTKs, Gab proteins can recruit several signaling molecules (p85, SHP2, and Crk), and subsequently activate multiple transmitting signals that are critical for cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptotic process. Recently, it has been reported that Gab2 polymorphism is associated with the increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Assemblies of Abeta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Abeta- secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. The generation of Abeta is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Abeta. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate gamma-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Other insulin-related mechanisms have been implicated in normal hippocampal functioning in addition to insulin-receptormodulation. For example, insulin may modulate long-term potentiation (LTP), a molecular model of learning. LTP can be induced by N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, thus increasing neuronal Ca2+ influx. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ level presumably activates Î±-calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (Î±CaMKII) and other Ca2+-dependent enzymes, eventuating in stronger synaptic associations between neurons. Insulin may influence several constituents of this LTP cascade. For example, insulin promoted the cellmembrane expression of NMDA receptors,[60] which may increase the likelihood of LTP induction.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We report that infection of human primary neural cells with a high phenotypic reactivator HSV-1 (17syn+) induces upregulation of a brain- enriched microRNA (miRNA)-146a that is associated with proinflammatory signaling in stressed brain cells and Alzheimer's disease. Expression of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, the inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2, and the neuroinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta were each upregulated. A known miRNA-146a target in the brain, complement factor H, was downregulated. These data suggest a role for HSV-1-induced miRNA-146a in the evasion of HSV-1 from the complement system, and the activation of key elements of the arachidonic acid cascade known to contribute to Alzheimer-type neuropathological change.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA. Understanding molecular mechanisms decreasing PPARgamma might help to better appreciate inflammatory diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	During differentiation of macrophages primarily the promoter 3 and to a certain extent promoter 1 is activated. Consequently macrophages mainly express PPARγ1 (10). In macrophages PPARγ represses inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase induction as well as concomitant NO production (11) and attenuates the oxidative burst (13, 14). Moreover, inhibiting nuclear factor ÎºB (NFÎºB) decreases expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) or IL-6 (12). Thus, PPARγ is important to shape an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype and appears crucial for dampening inflammation	IL1B	NFKB2	Brüne B	"p(HGNC:""IL1B"")"	20164187.0	increases	"p(HGNC:""NFKB2"")"	MicroRNA-27b contributes to lipopolysaccharide-mediated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA destabilization.
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Granulin (GRN, or progranulin) is a protein involved in wound repair, inflammation, and neoplasia. GRN has also been directly implicated in frontotemporal dementia and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, GRN regulation expression is poorly understood. A high-throughput experimental microRNA assay showed that GRN is the strongest target for miR-107 in human H4 neuroglioma cells. miR-107 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and sequence elements in the open reading frame-rather than the 3' untranslated region-of GRN mRNA are recognized by miR-107 and are highly conserved among vertebrate species. To better understand the mechanism of this interaction, FLAG-tagged Argonaute constructs were used following miR-107 transfection. GRN mRNA interacts preferentially with Argonaute 2. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that regulation of GRN by miR-107 may be functionally important. Glucose supplementation in cultured cells that leads to increased miR-107 levels also results in decreased GRN expression, including changes in cell compartmentation and decreased secretion of GRN protein. This effect was eliminated following miR-107 transfection. We also tested a mouse model where miR-107 has been shown to be down-regulated. In brain tissue subjacent to 1.0 mm depth controlled cortical impact, surviving hippocampal neurons show decreased miR-107 with augmentation of neuronal GRN expression. These findings indicate that miR-107 contributes to GRN expression regulation with implications for brain disorders.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Differential regulation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and IRAK-2 by microRNA-146a and NF-kappaB in stressed human astroglial cells and in Alzheimer disease.In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-κB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling. Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture. In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2. Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and amyloid-β-42 (Abeta42) peptide-stressed HAG cells. NF-κB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter. The NF-κB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated. Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected. These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1β+Abeta42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-κB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-κB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response. The interactive signaling of NF-κB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro- inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. The combinatorial use of NF-κB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing. Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects β-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Increased brain ceramide levels have been associated with sporadic AD, and are a suggested risk factor. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated. Therefore, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SPT and amyloid β (Abeta) generation. We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender. Finally, these results suggest SPT and the respective miRNAs may be potential therapeutic targets for sporadic AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	APP (amyloid precursor protein) and LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD (Alzheimer's disease). They are functionally linked by Fe65, a PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding)-domain-containing adaptor protein that binds to intracellular NPxY-motifs of APP and LRP1, thereby influencing expression levels, cellular trafficking and processing. Additionally, Fe65 has been reported to mediate nuclear signalling in combination with intracellular domains of APP and LRP1. We have previously identified another adaptor protein, GULP1 (engulfment adaptor PTB-domain-containing 1). In the present study we characterize and compare nuclear trafficking and transactivation of GULP1 and Fe65 together with APP and LRP1 and report differential nuclear trafficking of adaptors when APP or LRP1 are co-expressed. The observed effects were additionally supported by a reporter-plasmid-based transactivation assay. The results from the present study indicate that Fe65 might have signalling properties together with APP and LRP1, whereas GULP1 only mediates LRP1 transactivation.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-β. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-β (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here, we provide direct evidence of binding of miR-155 to a predicted binding site and the ability of miR-155 to repress SMAD2 protein expression. We employed a lentivirally transduced monocyte cell line (THP1-155) containing an inducible miR-155 transgene to show that endogenous levels of SMAD2 protein were decreased after sustained overexpression of miR-155. This decrease in SMAD2 led to a reduction in both TGF-beta-induced SMAD-2 phosphorylation and SMAD-2-dependent activation of the expression of the CAGA(12)LUC reporter plasmid. Overexpression of miR-155 altered the cellular responses to TGF-beta by changing the expression of a set of genes that is involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Our study provides firm evidence of a role for miR-155 in directly repressing SMAD2 expression, and our results demonstrate the relevance of one of the two predicted target sites in SMAD2 3'-UTR. Altogether, our data uncover an important role for miR-155 in modulating the cellular response to TGF-beta with possible implications in several human diseases where homeostasis of TGF-beta might be altered.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The γ-secretase complex comprises presenilins (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. Herein, we find that PEN-2 can interact with ferritin light chain (FTL), an important component of the iron storage protein ferritin. In addition, we show that overexpression of FTL increases the protein levels of PEN-2 and PS1 amino-terminal fragment (NTF) and promotes γ-secretase activity for more production of Abeta and notch intracellular domain (NICD). Furthermore, iron treatments increase the levels of FTL, PEN-2 and PS1 NTF and promote γ-secretase- mediated NICD production. Moreover, downregulation of FTL decreases the levels of PEN-2 and PS1 NTF. Together, our results suggest that iron can increase γ-secretase activity through promoting the level of FTL that interacts with and stabilizes PEN-2, providing a new molecular link between iron, PEN-2/γ-secretase and Abeta generation in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Background and Objective: Could a normal - but persistent - stress response to impeded axonal transport lead to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-Abeta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol- response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR- inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates are the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient's brain. Abeta is known to bind p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and mediates Abeta-induced neuronal death. Recently, we showed that NGF leads to p75(NTR) polyubiquitination, which promotes neuronal cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that Abeta stimulation impaired the p75(NTR) polyubiquitination. TRAF6 and p62 are required for polyubiquitination of p75(NTR) on NGF stimulation. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of TRAF6/p62 restored p75(NTR) polyubiquitination upon Abeta/NGF treatment. Abeta significantly reduced NFkappaB activity by attenuating the interaction of p75(NTR) with IKKbeta. p75(NTR) increased NFkappaB activity by recruiting TRAF6/p62, which thereby mediated cell survival.

In addition, as revealed by Western blot, small interfering RNA and immunofluorescence analysis, S100B-induced JNK activation increased expression of Dickopff-1 that, in turn, promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin degradation, causing canonical Wnt signaling pathway disruption and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. These findings propose a previously unrecognized link between S100B and tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting S100B can contribute to NFT formation in AD and in all other conditions in which neuroinflammation may have a crucial role.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Glial activation and increased inflammation characterize neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim was to develop a model for studying phagocytosis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide by human microglia and to test effects thereupon by immunomodulatory substances. Human CHME3 microglia showed intracellular Abeta(1-42) colocalized with lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, indicating phagocytosis. This was increased by interferon-gamma, and to a lesser degree with Protollin, a proteosome-based adjuvant. Secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was decreased by Abeta(1-42) and by interferon-gamma and interleukin-1beta. These cytokines, but not Abeta(1-42), stimulated interleukin-6 release. Microglia which phagocytosed Abeta(1-42) exhibited a higher degree of expression of interleukin-1 receptor type I and inducible nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, we show that human microglia are able to phagocytose Abeta(1-42) and that this is associated with expression of inflammatory markers. Abeta(1-42) and interferon-gamma decreased BDNF secretion suggesting a new neuropathological role for Abeta(1-42) and the inflammation accompanying AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Upon binding, LRP8 transduces reelin signaling during neuronal development, and recent evidence has indicated that it interacts with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor, being involved in neuronal functions such as maturation of NMDA receptor composition in the hippocampus, and the regulation of long-term potentiation. Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	gene mutation of presenilin, which is a component of the gamma- secretase complex and is associated with familial AD, results in an attenuation of ER chaperone expression during ER stress. Mutations in presenilin inhibit activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, all of which act as signal transducers of ER stress in the ER membrane (for details, see the article by Hosoi and Ozawa in this Forum Minireview series: Ref. 14), thereby making neurons vulnerable to ER stress. In addition, nitric oxideâ€“induced S-nitrosylation of ER chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to ER stressâ€“induced neuronal death. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of PDI has been observed in the brain of sporadic AD and PD patients. ER stress can also cause AD onset. For example, eIF2a phosphorylation, which is induced by eIF2a kinase PERK, elevates BACE1 (Abeta-secretase) levels and causes increased Abeta production (17). Furthermore, Abeta has been reported to induce ER stress, leading to activation of ER stressâ€“specific initiator caspases, including mouse caspase- 12 and human caspase-4. In conclusion, because postmortem AD patient brain samples exhibit activated UPR markers, including phosphorylated PERK, eIF2a, and IRE1, ER stress probably plays a key role in AD pathogenesis as a cause or consequence	EIF2AK3	PSEN2	Nomura Y	"p(HGNC:""EIF2AK3"")"	22382662.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""PSEN2"")"	Molecular approaches to the treatment, prophylaxis, and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: possible involvement of HRD1, a novel molecule related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In SHSY5Y cells, a human neuroblastom a cell line, as well as in primary cultu res of rat cortical neurons insulin ad ministrat ion leads to tau hyperphosphorylation (111-113]. In contrast, insulin and IGF- 1 administration in NT2N cells, cultured human neurons, decreases tau phosphorylat ion [114]. In primary cortical n euron cultures, M esk e et a/ . (115J found that insulin treatment causes a regulatory interaction between PP2A and GSK-3. Inhibition of Pl3-kinase leads to activat ion of GSK-3and PP2A. Enzyme activity of both enzymes al ways changed in the same direction. This balÂ­ anced response seemed to induce a steady state in tau phosÂ­ phorylation at GSK-3/PP2A-dependent sites (115]. Thus, on ly a dysbalance of insulin/IGF-1 regulated tau kinases and phosphatases might lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, partially explaining the different resu lts obtained under different conditions.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here we provide evidence in human neural (HN) cells of an aluminum- sulfate- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated up-regulation of an NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a that down-regulates the expression of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of inflammation. This NF-kappaB-miRNA-146a-CFH signaling circuit is known to be similarly affected by Abeta42 peptides and in AD brain. These aluminum-sulfate-inducible events were not observed in parallel experiments using iron-, magnesium-, or zinc-sulfate-stressed HN cells. An NF-kappaB-containing miRNA-146a-promoter-luciferase reporter construct transfected into HN cells showed significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a after aluminum-sulfate treatment that corresponded to decreased CFH gene expression. These data suggest that (1) as in AD brain, NF-kappaB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated, modulation of CFH gene expression may contribute to inflammatory responses in aluminum- stressed HN cells, and (2) underscores the potential of nanomolar aluminum to drive genotoxic mechanisms characteristic of neurodegenerative disease processes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Genome-wide analysis of miRNA expression reveals a potential role for miR-144 in brain aging and spinocerebellar ataxia pathogenesis. Notably, miR-144 that is highly conserved appeared to be associated with the aging progression. Moreover, miR-144 plays a central role in regulating the expression of ataxin 1 (ATXN1), the disease-causing gene for the development spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). miRNA activity, including miR-144, -101 and -130 processing, was increased in the cerebellum and cortex of SCA1 Alzheimer patients relative to healthy aged brains. Importantly, miR-144 and -101 inhibition increased ATXN1 levels in human cells. Thus, the activation of miRNA expression in the aging brain may serve to reduce the cytotoxic effect of polyglutamine expanded ATXN1 and the deregulation of miRNA expression may be a risk factor for disease development.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	MicroRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) is an inducible, 22 nucleotide, small RNA over-expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Up-regulated miRNA-146a targets several inflammation-related and membrane- associated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), including those encoding complement factor-H (CFH) and the interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), resulting in significant decreases in their expression (p<0.05, ANOVA). In this study we assayed miRNA-146a, CFH, IRAK-1 and tetraspanin-12 (TSPAN12), abundances in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) co-cultures, in human astroglial (HAG) and microglial (HMG) cells stressed with Abeta42 peptide and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The results indicate a consistent inverse relationship between miRNA-146a and CFH, IRAK-1 and TSPAN12 expression levels, and indicate that HNG, HAG and HMG cell types each respond differently to Abeta42-peptide+TNFalpha-triggered stress. While the strongest miRNA-146a-IRAK-1 response was found in HAG cells, the largest miRNA-146a-TSPAN12 response was found in HNG cells, and the most significant miRNA-146a-CFH changes were found in HMG cells, the 'resident scavenging macrophages' of the brain.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer disease, the most common tauopathy, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles that are mainly composed of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline- directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3β and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau. Together, these results indicate that Pin1 is generally involved in the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation and hence the etiology of tauopathies.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-β. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-β (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

MiR-34a triggers endothelial senescence in part through SIRT1, since forced expression of SIRT1 blocks the ability of miR-34a to induce senescence.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Seladin-1 was considered a novel neuroprotective factor, because of its anti-apoptotic activity. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that seladin-1 has also enzymatic activity [3-β-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase, (DHCR24)], which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. The amount of membrane cholesterol may play an important role both in protecting neuronal cells against toxic insults and in inhibiting the production of β-amyloid. We demonstrated that seladin-1 overexpression increases the amount of membrane cholesterol and induces resistance against β-amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a specific inhibitor of DHCR24 increased cell vulnerability. We also hypothesized that seladin-1 might be a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens. We first demonstrated that, in human fetal neuroepithelial cells (FNC), 17β-estradiol, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert protective effects against β-amyloid toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, these molecules significantly increased the expression of seladin-1 and the amount of cell cholesterol. Then, we showed that, upon seladin-1 silencing, the protective effects of estrogens were abolished, thus indicating this factor as a fundamental mediator of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, at least in FNC cells. Furthermore, we detected the presence of functionally active half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. Overall, our results indicate that seladin-1 may be viewed as a multi-faceted protein, which conjugates both the neuroprotective properties of estrogens and the important functions of cholesterol in maintaining brain homeostasis	APP	DHCR24	Cellai I	"p(HGNC:""APP"",frag(""672_713""))"	21396986.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""DHCR24"")"	Membrane cholesterol as a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens.
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The moderating effect of rivastigmine on the endotoxin-induced suppression of GnRH/LH secretion may result from the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines released through the cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway. AChE inhibitors lead to an increase in the concentration of ACh and activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Borovikova et al., 2000). These inhibitors attenuate the cytokine release, including that of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFÎ±, which have been previously described both in vitro and in vivo ( Borovikova et al., 2000 and Pollak et al., 2005). The ability of rivastigmine to reduce the inflammatory action within the brain could have a profound effect on GnRH secretion, as numerous studies have reported that centrally acting pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1β but also IL-1Î± and TNFÎ±, may be primarily responsible for the inhibition of GnRH/LH secretion	GNRH1	TNF	Tomaszewska-Zaremba D	"p(HGNC:""GNRH1"")"	23557940.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""TNF"")"	The effect of rivastigmine on the LPS-induced suppression of GnRH/LH secretion during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in ewes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate that Abeta oligomers compromise BDNF-mediated retrograde transport by impairing endosomal vesicle velocities, resulting in impaired downstream signaling driven by BDNF/TrkB, including ERK5 activation, and CREB-dependent gene regulation. Our data suggest that a key mechanism mediating the deficit involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme that functions to regulate cellular ubiquitin. Abeta-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, Abeta may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid β (Abeta) aggregates are the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient's brain. Abeta is known to bind p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and mediates Abeta-induced neuronal death. Recently, we showed that NGF leads to p75(NTR) polyubiquitination, which promotes neuronal cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that Abeta stimulation impaired the p75(NTR) polyubiquitination. TRAF6 and p62 are required for polyubiquitination of p75(NTR) on NGF stimulation. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of TRAF6/p62 restored p75(NTR) polyubiquitination upon Abeta/NGF treatment. Abeta significantly reduced NF-ÎºB activity by attenuating the interaction of p75(NTR) with IKKβ. p75(NTR) increased NF-ÎºB activity by recruiting TRAF6/p62, which thereby mediated cell survival. These findings indicate that TRAF6/p62 abrogated the Abeta- mediated inhibition of p75(NTR) polyubiquitination and restored neuronal cell survival.

Furthermore, 15d-PGJ(2) suppressed the Abeta-related synergistic induction of CD14, MyD88, and Toll-like receptor 2, molecules that play critical roles in neuroinflammatory conditions.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	gene mutation of presenilin, which is a component of the gamma- secretase complex and is associated with familial AD, results in an attenuation of ER chaperone expression during ER stress. Mutations in presenilin inhibit activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, all of which act as signal transducers of ER stress in the ER membrane (for details, see the article by Hosoi and Ozawa in this Forum Minireview series: Ref. 14), thereby making neurons vulnerable to ER stress. In addition, nitric oxideâ€“induced S-nitrosylation of ER chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to ER stressâ€“induced neuronal death. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of PDI has been observed in the brain of sporadic AD and PD patients. ER stress can also cause AD onset. For example, eIF2a phosphorylation, which is induced by eIF2a kinase PERK, elevates BACE1 (Abeta-secretase) levels and causes increased Abeta production (17). Furthermore, Abeta has been reported to induce ER stress, leading to activation of ER stressâ€“specific initiator caspases, including mouse caspase- 12 and human caspase-4. In conclusion, because postmortem AD patient brain samples exhibit activated UPR markers, including phosphorylated PERK, eIF2a, and IRE1, ER stress probably plays a key role in AD pathogenesis as a cause or consequence	ATF6	PSEN1	Nomura Y	"p(HGNC:""ATF6"")"	22382662.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""PSEN1"")"	Molecular approaches to the treatment, prophylaxis, and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: possible involvement of HRD1, a novel molecule related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, in Alzheimer's disease.

Expression of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, the inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2, and the neuroinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta were each upregulated. A known miRNA-146a target in the brain, complement factor H, was downregulated. These data suggest a role for HSV-1-induced miRNA-146a in the evasion of HSV-1 from the complement system, and the activation of key elements of the arachidonic acid cascade known to contribute to Alzheimer-type neuropathological change.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Genome-wide analysis of miRNA expression reveals a potential role for miR-144 in brain aging and spinocerebellar ataxia pathogenesis. Notably, miR-144 that is highly conserved appeared to be associated with the aging progression. Moreover, miR-144 plays a central role in regulating the expression of ataxin 1 (ATXN1), the disease-causing gene for the development spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). miRNA activity, including miR-144, -101 and -130 processing, was increased in the cerebellum and cortex of SCA1 Alzheimer patients relative to healthy aged brains. Importantly, miR-144 and -101 inhibition increased ATXN1 levels in human cells. Thus, the activation of miRNA expression in the aging brain may serve to reduce the cytotoxic effect of polyglutamine expanded ATXN1 and the deregulation of miRNA expression may be a risk factor for disease development.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	MicroRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) is an inducible, 22 nucleotide, small RNA over-expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Up-regulated miRNA-146a targets several inflammation-related and membrane- associated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), including those encoding complement factor-H (CFH) and the interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), resulting in significant decreases in their expression (p<0.05, ANOVA). In this study we assayed miRNA-146a, CFH, IRAK-1 and tetraspanin-12 (TSPAN12), abundances in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) co-cultures, in human astroglial (HAG) and microglial (HMG) cells stressed with Abeta42 peptide and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The results indicate a consistent inverse relationship between miRNA-146a and CFH, IRAK-1 and TSPAN12 expression levels, and indicate that HNG, HAG and HMG cell types each respond differently to Abeta42-peptide+TNFalpha-triggered stress. While the strongest miRNA-146a-IRAK-1 response was found in HAG cells, the largest miRNA-146a-TSPAN12 response was found in HNG cells, and the most significant miRNA-146a-CFH changes were found in HMG cells, the 'resident scavenging macrophages' of the brain.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Eleven miRNAs were selected, which have evolutionary conserved binding sites. Three of them (miR-103, miR-107, miR-1306) were further analysed as they are linked to AD and most strictly conserved between different species. Predicted target genes of miR-103 (p-value = 0.0065) and miR-107 (p-value = 0.0009) showed significant overlap with the AlzGene database except for miR-1306. Interactions between miR-103 and miR-107 to genes were revealed playing a role in processes leading to AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid β-peptide (Abeta) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-β. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-β (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including tumor metastasis and Alzheimer's disease. However, mechanisms that regulate LRP1 expression under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are not unclear. In human cell lines, we found that miR-205 down-regulates the expression of LRP1 by targeting sequences in the 3'UTR of LRP1 mRNA. This effect was abolished by deleting the miR-205 seed site in the 3'UTR of LRP1. The ectopic expression of miR-205 also significantly mitigated migration of both U87 and SK-LU-1 cells. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that expression of human LRP1 is regulated in part by a specific miRNA, leading to decreased tumor cell migration.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta.

Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, Abeta may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.

Calsyntenin-1 is a ligand for kinesin-1 light chains and APP is transported through axons on kinesin-1 molecular motors.

Gakhar-Koppole et al. (2008) and Rohe et al.

Furthermore, 15d-PGJ(2) suppressed the Abeta-related synergistic induction of CD14, MyD88, and Toll-like receptor 2, molecules that play critical roles in neuroinflammatory conditions.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand. Our results suggest a central role for sHsps in the neuroinflammatory reaction in AD and CAA and thus in contributing to cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a protective mechanism against ER stress in which unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER are selectively transported to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We cloned the novel ubiquitin ligase HRD1, which is involved in ERAD, and showed that HRD1 promoted amyloid precursor protein (APP) ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of amyloid Abeta (Abeta). In addition, suppression of HRD1 expression caused APP accumulation and promoted Abeta generation associated with ER stress and apoptotic process. Interestingly, HRD1 levels were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the brains of these patients experienced ER stress. Our recent study revealed that this decrease in HRD1 was due to its insolubilization; however, controversy persists about whether the decrease in HRD1 protein promotes Abeta generation or whether Abeta neurotoxicity causes the decrease in HRD1 protein levels. Here, we review current findings on the mechanism of HRD1 protein loss in the AD brain and the involvement of HRD1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, we propose that HRD1 may be a target for novel AD therapeutics.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	gene mutation of presenilin, which is a component of the gamma- secretase complex and is associated with familial AD, results in an attenuation of ER chaperone expression during ER stress. Mutations in presenilin inhibit activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, all of which act as signal transducers of ER stress in the ER membrane (for details, see the article by Hosoi and Ozawa in this Forum Minireview series: Ref. 14), thereby making neurons vulnerable to ER stress. In addition, nitric oxideâ€“induced S-nitrosylation of ER chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to ER stressâ€“induced neuronal death. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of PDI has been observed in the brain of sporadic AD and PD patients. ER stress can also cause AD onset. For example, eIF2a phosphorylation, which is induced by eIF2a kinase PERK, elevates BACE1 (Abeta-secretase) levels and causes increased Abeta production (17). Furthermore, Abeta has been reported to induce ER stress, leading to activation of ER stressâ€“specific initiator caspases, including mouse caspase- 12 and human caspase-4.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARγ leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in β-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3β is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARγ by a potent ligand leads to β-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARγ activation in neuroprotection, PPARγ agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARγ activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARγ in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARγ protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005].

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Furthermore, in C. elegans the DAF-2 pathway is proÂ­ posed to control longevity [I 37]. However, decreased DAF- 2 signaling causes a considerable lifespan extension [137, 138]. The longevity in DAF-2 mutant animals is negatively influenced by mutations in DAF-16, indicating that DAF-16 is inhibited by DAF-2 and is a major downstream effector. Similar findings were seen in Drosophila melanogaster where insulin signaling is mediated via chico the ortholog of human IRS. If either the lR or chico is mutated, lifespan of these flies is prolonged [139, 140]. Also, overexpression of dFoxO, the ortholog of human FOXO, decreases mortality and increases I ifespan in Drosophila [ 141].

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA. Understanding molecular mechanisms decreasing PPARgamma might help to better appreciate inflammatory diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We report here that BACE1-antisense prevents miRNA-induced repression of BACE1 mRNA by masking the binding site for miR-485-5p. Indeed, miR-485-5p and BACE1-antisense compete for binding within the same region in the open reading frame of the BACE1 mRNA. We observed opposing effects of BACE1-antisense and miR-485-5p on BACE1 protein in vitro and showed that Locked Nucleic Acid-antimiR mediated knockdown of miR-485-5p as well as BACE1-antisense over-expression can prevent the miRNA-induced BACE1 suppression. We found that the expression of BACE1-antisense as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Using a bioinformatics screen to identify sequence motifs enriched in the 3'UTR of rapidly destabilized mRNAs, we identified a developmentally and activity-regulated miRNA (miR-485) that controls dendritic spine number and synapse formation in an activity-dependent homeostatic manner. We find that many plasticity-associated genes contain predicted miR-485 binding sites and further identify the presynaptic protein SV2A as a target of miR-485. miR-485 negatively regulated dendritic spine density, postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) clustering, and surface expression of GluR2. Furthermore, miR-485 overexpression reduced spontaneous synaptic responses and transmitter release, as measured by miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) analysis and FM 1-43 staining. SV2A knockdown mimicked the effects of miR-485, and these effects were reversed by SV2A overexpression. Moreover, 5 d of increased synaptic activity induced homeostatic changes in synaptic specializations that were blocked by a miR-485 inhibitor. Our findings reveal a role for this previously uncharacterized miRNA and the presynaptic protein SV2A in homeostatic plasticity and nervous system development, with possible implications in neurological disorders (e.g., Huntington and Alzheimer's disease), where miR-485 has been found to be dysregulated.

Predicted target genes of miR-103 (p-value = 0.0065) and miR-107 (p-value = 0.0009) showed significant overlap with the AlzGene database except for miR-1306. Interactions between miR-103 and miR-107 to genes were revealed playing a role in processes leading to AD. ADAM10 expression in the reporter assay was reduced by miR-1306 (28%), miR-103 (45%) and miR-107 (52%).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid β-peptide (Abeta) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer disease, the most common tauopathy, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles that are mainly composed of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline- directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3β and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau. Together, these results indicate that Pin1 is generally involved in the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation and hence the etiology of tauopathies.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-β. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-β (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	There is a physiological decline of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin- like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis with ageing and the possibility that the GH/ IGF-I axis is involved in cognitive deficits has been recognized for several years. The IGF-I is a potent neurotrophic as well neuroprotective factor found in the brain with a wide range of actions in both central and peripheral nervous system. IGF-I is a critical promoter of brain development and neuronal survival and plays a role in neuronal rescue during degenerative diseases.When a cholinesterase inhibitor as rivastigmine, a drug for AD, is acutely administered the area under the curve of the GH response to GHRH doubled, showing that rivastigmine is a powerful drug to enhance GH release.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The moderating effect of rivastigmine on the endotoxin-induced suppression of GnRH/LH secretion may result from the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines released through the cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway. AChE inhibitors lead to an increase in the concentration of ACh and activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Borovikova et al., 2000). These inhibitors attenuate the cytokine release, including that of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFÎ±, which have been previously described both in vitro and in vivo ( Borovikova et al., 2000 and Pollak et al., 2005). The ability of rivastigmine to reduce the inflammatory action within the brain could have a profound effect on GnRH secretion, as numerous studies have reported that centrally acting pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1β but also IL-1Î± and TNFÎ±, may be primarily responsible for the inhibition of GnRH/LH secretion	GNRH1	IL1B	Tomaszewska-Zaremba D	"p(HGNC:""GNRH1"")"	23557940.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""IL1B"")"	The effect of rivastigmine on the LPS-induced suppression of GnRH/LH secretion during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in ewes.

These effects can be restored by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of cdk5. Moreover, cdk5-deficient cultured cortical neurons exhibit increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, as well as elevated JNK3 activity and c-Jun phosphorylation.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand. Our results suggest a central role for sHsps in the neuroinflammatory reaction in AD and CAA and thus in contributing to cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Tau toxicity has been implicated in the emergence of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism by which tau alters synapse physiology and leads to cognitive decline is unclear. Here we report abnormal acetylation of K274 and K281 on tau, identified in AD brains, promotes memory loss and disrupts synaptic plasticity by reducing postsynaptic KIdney/BRAin (KIBRA) protein, a memory-associated protein.acetylated tau reduces synaptic KIBRA levels and disrupts activity-induced postsynaptic actin remodeling and AMPA receptor insertion. The LTP deficit was rescued by promoting actin polymerization or by KIBRA expression. In AD patients with dementia, we found enhanced tau acetylation is linked to loss of KIBRA. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which pathogenic tau causes synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Upon binding, LRP8 transduces reelin signaling during neuronal development, and recent evidence has indicated that it interacts with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor, being involved in neuronal functions such as maturation of NMDA receptor composition in the hippocampus, and the regulation of long-term potentiation. Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	gene mutation of presenilin, which is a component of the gamma- secretase complex and is associated with familial AD, results in an attenuation of ER chaperone expression during ER stress. Mutations in presenilin inhibit activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, all of which act as signal transducers of ER stress in the ER membrane (for details, see the article by Hosoi and Ozawa in this Forum Minireview series: Ref. 14), thereby making neurons vulnerable to ER stress. In addition, nitric oxideâ€“induced S-nitrosylation of ER chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to ER stressâ€“induced neuronal death. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of PDI has been observed in the brain of sporadic AD and PD patients. ER stress can also cause AD onset. For example, eIF2a phosphorylation, which is induced by eIF2a kinase PERK, elevates BACE1 (Abeta-secretase) levels and causes increased Abeta production (17). Furthermore, Abeta has been reported to induce ER stress, leading to activation of ER stressâ€“specific initiator caspases, including mouse caspase- 12 and human caspase-4. In conclusion, because postmortem AD patient brain samples exhibit activated UPR markers, including phosphorylated PERK, eIF2a, and IRE1, ER stress probably plays a key role in AD pathogenesis as a cause or consequence	EIF2AK3	PSEN1	Nomura Y	"p(HGNC:""EIF2AK3"")"	22382662.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""PSEN1"")"	Molecular approaches to the treatment, prophylaxis, and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: possible involvement of HRD1, a novel molecule related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, in Alzheimer's disease.

Here, we show that cdk5 directly phosphorylates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) on Thr131 and inhibits its kinase activity, leading to reduced c-Jun phosphorylation. These effects can be restored by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of cdk5. Moreover, cdk5-deficient cultured cortical neurons exhibit increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, as well as elevated JNK3 activity and c-Jun phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings show that cdk5 may exert its role as a key element by negatively regulating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathway during neuronal apoptotic process.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Tau is a microtubule-binding protein that ligates tubulin and accounts for the stability of microtubules. If hyperphosÂ­ phorylated, tau aggregates and interferes with intraneu ronal metabolism and transport lead ing to neurodegeneration [I 02]. Tau phosphorylation state is regulated by site-specific dephosphorylation through certain phosphatases and by kinases phosphorylating tau protein at specific sites. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the major phosphatase with 70% tau phosphatase activity in human brains [I 03]. This implies a protective role of PP2A in neurodegeneration which is consistent with the finding that PP2A activity is reduced in AD brains [104, 105]. The phosphorylation of tau is mainly promoted by GSK-3and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Besides these kinases, activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and ERK-1 /-2 signaling lead to an increase in tau phosphorylation and th erefore might be of importance in AD pathogenesis. GSK-3is a serine/threonine kinase, moduÂ­ lated by insulin/IGF-1 signaling. When the IRIIGF-IR pathÂ­ way is activated, GSK-3is phosphorylated by AKT at Scr 9 leading to its inactivation [I 06-109]. However, PP2A dephosphorylates GSK-3(review in [II 0]), which then phosphorylates tau at several sites leading to an equilibrium of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tau (Overview : see Fig. 1). Thus, impaired IRIIGF-1 R signaling might lead to hyperphosphory lation of tau protein and an in creased forÂ­ mation of neurofibrillary tangles.

Enzyme activity of both enzymes al ways changed in the same direction. This balÂ­ anced response seemed to induce a steady state in tau phosÂ­ phorylation at GSK-3/PP2A-dependent sites (115]. Thus, on ly a dysbalance of insulin/IGF-1 regulated tau kinases and phosphatases might lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, partially explaining the different resu lts obtained under different conditions.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	During differentiation of macrophages primarily the promoter 3 and to a certain extent promoter 1 is activated. Consequently macrophages mainly express PPARγ1 (10). In macrophages PPARγ represses inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase induction as well as concomitant NO production (11) and attenuates the oxidative burst (13, 14). Moreover, inhibiting nuclear factor ÎºB (NFÎºB) decreases expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) or IL-6 (12). Thus, PPARγ is important to shape an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype and appears crucial for dampening inflammation	NOS2	PPARG	Brüne B	"p(HGNC:""NOS2"")"	20164187.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""PPARG"")"	MicroRNA-27b contributes to lipopolysaccharide-mediated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA destabilization.
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Differential regulation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and IRAK-2 by microRNA-146a and NF-kappaB in stressed human astroglial cells and in Alzheimer disease.In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-κB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling. Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture. In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2. Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and amyloid-β-42 (Abeta42) peptide-stressed HAG cells. NF-κB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter. The NF-κB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated. Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected. These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1β+Abeta42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-κB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-κB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response. The interactive signaling of NF-κB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro- inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. The combinatorial use of NF-κB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	MicroRNA-101 downregulates Alzheimer's amyloid-β precursor protein levels in human cell cultures and is differentially expressed.Several bioinformatic algorithms predicted miR-101 target sites within the APP 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Using reporter assays, we confirmed that, in human cell cultures, miR-101 significantly reduced the expression of a reporter under control of APP 3'-UTR. Mutation of predicted site 1, but not site 2, eliminated this reporter response. Delivery of miR-101 directly to human HeLa cells significantly reduced APP levels and this effect was eliminated by co-transfection with a miR-101 antisense inhibitor. Delivery of a specific target protector designed to blockade the interaction between miR-101 and its functional target site within APP 3'-UTR enhanced APP levels in HeLa. Therefore, endogenous miR-101 regulates expression of APP in human cells via a specific site located within its 3'-UTR. Finally, we demonstrate that, across a series of human cell lines, highest expression of miR-101 levels was observed in model NT2 neurons.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	MicroRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) is an inducible, 22 nucleotide, small RNA over-expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Up-regulated miRNA-146a targets several inflammation-related and membrane- associated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), including those encoding complement factor-H (CFH) and the interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), resulting in significant decreases in their expression (p<0.05, ANOVA). In this study we assayed miRNA-146a, CFH, IRAK-1 and tetraspanin-12 (TSPAN12), abundances in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) co-cultures, in human astroglial (HAG) and microglial (HMG) cells stressed with Abeta42 peptide and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The results indicate a consistent inverse relationship between miRNA-146a and CFH, IRAK-1 and TSPAN12 expression levels, and indicate that HNG, HAG and HMG cell types each respond differently to Abeta42-peptide+TNFalpha-triggered stress. While the strongest miRNA-146a-IRAK-1 response was found in HAG cells, the largest miRNA-146a-TSPAN12 response was found in HNG cells, and the most significant miRNA-146a-CFH changes were found in HMG cells, the 'resident scavenging macrophages' of the brain.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Using a bioinformatics screen to identify sequence motifs enriched in the 3'UTR of rapidly destabilized mRNAs, we identified a developmentally and activity-regulated miRNA (miR-485) that controls dendritic spine number and synapse formation in an activity-dependent homeostatic manner. We find that many plasticity-associated genes contain predicted miR-485 binding sites and further identify the presynaptic protein SV2A as a target of miR-485. miR-485 negatively regulated dendritic spine density, postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) clustering, and surface expression of GluR2. Furthermore, miR-485 overexpression reduced spontaneous synaptic responses and transmitter release, as measured by miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) analysis and FM 1-43 staining. SV2A knockdown mimicked the effects of miR-485, and these effects were reversed by SV2A overexpression. Moreover, 5 d of increased synaptic activity induced homeostatic changes in synaptic specializations that were blocked by a miR-485 inhibitor. Our findings reveal a role for this previously uncharacterized miRNA and the presynaptic protein SV2A in homeostatic plasticity and nervous system development, with possible implications in neurological disorders (e.g., Huntington and Alzheimer's disease), where miR-485 has been found to be dysregulated.

Predicted target genes of miR-103 (p-value = 0.0065) and miR-107 (p-value = 0.0009) showed significant overlap with the AlzGene database except for miR-1306. Interactions between miR-103 and miR-107 to genes were revealed playing a role in processes leading to AD. ADAM10 expression in the reporter assay was reduced by miR-1306 (28%), miR-103 (45%) and miR-107 (52%).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid β-peptide (Abeta) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-β. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-β (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The moderating effect of rivastigmine on the endotoxin-induced suppression of GnRH/LH secretion may result from the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines released through the cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway. AChE inhibitors lead to an increase in the concentration of ACh and activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Borovikova et al., 2000). These inhibitors attenuate the cytokine release, including that of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFÎ±, which have been previously described both in vitro and in vivo ( Borovikova et al., 2000 and Pollak et al., 2005). The ability of rivastigmine to reduce the inflammatory action within the brain could have a profound effect on GnRH secretion, as numerous studies have reported that centrally acting pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1β but also IL-1Î± and TNFÎ±, may be primarily responsible for the inhibition of GnRH/LH secretion	GNRH1	IL6	Tomaszewska-Zaremba D	"p(HGNC:""GNRH1"")"	23557940.0	decreases	"p(HGNC:""IL6"")"	The effect of rivastigmine on the LPS-induced suppression of GnRH/LH secretion during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in ewes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABeta¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF- receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABeta¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃƒÅ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃƒÅ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol- response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR- inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abeta deposits in AD, parenchymal as well as (cap)CAA and dyshoric angiopathy, are associated with a local inflammatory reaction, including activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that, among others, produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand. Our results suggest a central role for sHsps in the neuroinflammatory reaction in AD and CAA and thus in contributing to cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARγ leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in β-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3β is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARγ by a potent ligand leads to β-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARγ activation in neuroprotection, PPARγ agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARγ activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARγ in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARγ protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005].

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA. Understanding molecular mechanisms decreasing PPARgamma might help to better appreciate inflammatory diseases.

We hypothesize that CLA acts as an agonist or ligand, which binds with PPARγ and leads to the increase in APP cleavage via alpha-secretase-mediated pathway and the decrease in the deposition of Abeta.

Wnt-induced LRP6 phosphorylation is a key event in receptor activation (Tamai et al., 2004). LRP6, LRP5 and Arrow each have five reiterated PPPSPxS motifs (P, proline; S, serine or threonine, x, a variable residue), which are essential for LRP6 function and are each transferrable to a heterologous receptor to result in constitutive β-catenin signaling (MacDonald et al., 2008;Tamai et al., 2004;Zeng et al., 2005).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	MiR-107 is a microRNA (miRNA) that we reported previously to have decreased expression in the temporal cortical gray matter early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we study a new group of well-characterized human temporal cortex samples (N=19). MiR-107 expression was assessed, normalized to miR-124 and let-7a. Correlation was observed between decreased miR-107 expression and increased neuritic plaque counts (P< 0.05) and neurofibrillary tangle counts (P< 0.02) in adjacent brain tissue. Adjusted miR-107 and BACE1 mRNA levels tended to correlate negatively (trend with regression P< 0.07). In sum, miR-107 expression tends to be lower relative to other miRNAs as AD progresses.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Increased brain ceramide levels have been associated with sporadic AD, and are a suggested risk factor. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated. Therefore, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SPT and amyloid β (Abeta) generation. We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender.

Analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial components and proinflammatory cytokines. By means of promoter analysis, miR-146a was found to be a NF-kappaB-dependent gene. Importantly, miR-146a/b were predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3' UTRs of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and IL-1 receptor- associated kinase 1 genes, and we found that these UTRs inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene. These genes encode two key adapter molecules downstream of Toll-like and cytokine receptors.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here we report that the levels of a human brain-enriched miRNA-125b are up-regulated in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-stressed normal human astrocytes (NHA), a treatment known to induce astrogliosis. In vitro, anti-miRNA-125b added exogenously to IL-6-stressed NHA cultures attenuated both glial cell proliferation and increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), a miRNA-125b target and negative regulator of cell growth. A strong positive correlation between miRNA-125b abundance and the glial cell markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, and CDKN2A down- regulation was noted in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in Down's syndrome (DS) brain, chronic neurological disorders associated with astrogliosis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Increased brain ceramide levels have been associated with sporadic AD, and are a suggested risk factor. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated. Therefore, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SPT and amyloid β (Abeta) generation. We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Down's syndrome brain is typified by activated microglia, increases in inflammatory signaling, and an aberrant immune system. In these studies, a screening of micro-RNA (miRNA) from Down's syndrome brain and peripheral tissues indicated an upregulation of a chromosome 21-encoded miRNA-155 and a decrease in the abundance of the miRNA-155 mRNA target complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of the innate immune response. Stressed primary human neuronal-glial cells indicated both miRNA-155 increase and CFH downregulation, an effect that was reversed using anti-miRNA-155. These findings suggest that immunopathological deficits associated with Down's syndrome can, in part, be explained by a generalized miRNA-155-mediated downregulation of CFH that may contribute to both brain and systemic immune pathology.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Expression profiling of 200 microRNAs in human monocytes revealed that several of them (miR-146a/b, miR-132, and miR-155) are endotoxin- responsive genes. Analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial components and proinflammatory cytokines. By means of promoter analysis, miR-146a was found to be a NF-kappaB-dependent gene. Importantly, miR-146a/b were predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3' UTRs of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and IL-1 receptor- associated kinase 1 genes, and we found that these UTRs inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene. These genes encode two key adapter molecules downstream of Toll-like and cytokine receptors. Thus, we propose a role for miR-146 in control of Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling through a negative feedback regulation loop involving down-regulation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 protein levels.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We found that miRs 18 and 124a reduced GR-mediated events in addition to decreasing GR protein levels. miR reporter assays revealed binding of miR-124a to the 3' untranslated region of GR. In correspondence, the activation of the GR-responsive gene glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper was strongly impaired by miR-124a and -18 overexpression. Although miR-18 is expressed widely throughout the body, expression of miR-124a is restricted to the brain. Endogenous miR-124a up-regulation during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells was associated with a decreasing amount of GR protein levels and reduced activity of luciferase reporter constructs bearing GR 3' untranslated regions. Furthermore, we show that miR-124a expression varies over time during the stress hyporesponsive period, a neonatal period when GC signaling is modulated. Our findings demonstrate a potential role for miRs in the regulation of cell type-specific responsiveness to GCs, as may occur during critical periods of neuronal development.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The p53-family member TAp73 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in many biological processes. Here, we show that p73 drives the expression of microRNA (miR)-34a, but not miR-34b and -c, by acting on specific binding sites on the miR-34a promoter. Expression of miR-34a is modulated in parallel with that of TAp73 during in vitro differentiation of neuroblastoma cells and cortical neurons. Retinoid- driven neuroblastoma differentiation is inhibited by knockdown of either p73 or miR-34a. Transcript expression of miR-34a is significantly reduced in vivo both in the cortex and hippocampus of p73(-/-) mice; miR-34a and TAp73 expression also increase during postnatal development of the brain and cerebellum when synaptogenesis occurs. Accordingly, overexpression or silencing of miR-34a inversely modulates expression of synaptic targets, including synaptotagmin-1 and syntaxin-1A. Notably, the axis TAp73/miR-34a/synaptotagmin-1 is conserved in brains from Alzheimer's patients. These data reinforce a role for TAp73 in neuronal development.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We found that miRs 18 and 124a reduced GR-mediated events in addition to decreasing GR protein levels. miR reporter assays revealed binding of miR-124a to the 3' untranslated region of GR. In correspondence, the activation of the GR-responsive gene glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper was strongly impaired by miR-124a and -18 overexpression. Although miR-18 is expressed widely throughout the body, expression of miR-124a is restricted to the brain. Endogenous miR-124a up-regulation during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells was associated with a decreasing amount of GR protein levels and reduced activity of luciferase reporter constructs bearing GR 3' untranslated regions. Furthermore, we show that miR-124a expression varies over time during the stress hyporesponsive period, a neonatal period when GC signaling is modulated. Our findings demonstrate a potential role for miRs in the regulation of cell type-specific responsiveness to GCs, as may occur during critical periods of neuronal development.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a protective mechanism against ER stress in which unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER are selectively transported to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We cloned the novel ubiquitin ligase HRD1, which is involved in ERAD, and showed that HRD1 promoted amyloid precursor protein (APP) ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of amyloid Abeta (Abeta). In addition, suppression of HRD1 expression caused APP accumulation and promoted Abeta generation associated with ER stress and apoptotic process. Interestingly, HRD1 levels were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the brains of these patients experienced ER stress. Our recent study revealed that this decrease in HRD1 was due to its insolubilization; however, controversy persists about whether the decrease in HRD1 protein promotes Abeta generation or whether Abeta neurotoxicity causes the decrease in HRD1 protein levels. Here, we review current findings on the mechanism of HRD1 protein loss in the AD brain and the involvement of HRD1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, we propose that HRD1 may be a target for novel AD therapeutics.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Increased brain ceramide levels have been associated with sporadic AD, and are a suggested risk factor. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated. Therefore, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SPT and amyloid β (Abeta) generation. We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender. Finally, these results suggest SPT and the respective miRNAs may be potential therapeutic targets for sporadic AD.

Importantly, miR-146a/b were predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3' UTRs of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and IL-1 receptor- associated kinase 1 genes, and we found that these UTRs inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene. These genes encode two key adapter molecules downstream of Toll-like and cytokine receptors.

Then, the identification of these mediators may contribute to diagnosis. Our objective was to evaluate the levels of beta-amyloid (BA), tau, phospho-tau (p-tau) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL8 and CXCL10) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD and healthy controls. The correlation of these markers with clinical parameters was also evaluated. The levels of p-tau were higher in AD compared to controls, while the tau/p-tau ratio was decreased. The expression of CCL2 was increased in AD. A positive correlation was observed between BA levels and all chemokines studied, and between CCL2 and p-tau levels. Our results suggest that levels of CCL2 in CSF are involved in the pathogenesis of AD and it may be an additional useful biomarker for monitoring disease progression.

A strong positive correlation between miRNA-125b abundance and the glial cell markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, and CDKN2A down- regulation was noted in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in Down's syndrome (DS) brain, chronic neurological disorders associated with astrogliosis.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Inheritance of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the only confirmed and consistently replicated risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE is also a key ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), a major neuronal low-density lipoprotein receptor. ApoE and LRP mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the postmortem inferior temporal gyrus (area 20) and the hippocampus from individuals with dementia compared with those with intact cognition. In addition to their strong association with the progression of cognitive dysfunction, LRP and ApoE mRNA levels were also positively correlated with increasing neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Additionally, Western blot analysis of ApoE protein expression in the hippocampus showed that the differential expression observed at the transcriptional level is also reflected at the protein level. Given the critical role played by LRP and ApoE in amyloid beta (Abeta) and cholesterol trafficking, increased expression of LRP and ApoE may not only disrupt cholesterol homeostasis but may also contribute to some of the neurobiological features of AD, including plaque deposition.

We then used this gene expression profile to examine two mouse models of AD, the APPsw (Tg-2576) and Tg-SwDI, models for amyloid deposition and for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) respectively. AGI, MRC1 and YM1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the Tg-2576 mouse brains compared to age-matched controls while TNFalpha and NOS2 mRNA levels, genes commonly associated with classical activation, increased or did not change, respectively. Only TNFalpha mRNA increased in the Tg-SwDI mouse brain. Alternative activation genes were also identified in brain samples from individuals with AD and were compared to age-matched control individuals. In AD brain, mRNAs for TNFalpha, AGI, MRC1 and the chitinase-3 like 1 and 2 genes (CHI3L1; CHI3L2) were significantly increased while NOS2 and IL-1beta mRNAs were unchanged.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing. Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects β-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease.

Using several mouse models of inflammation, we now show that YKL-40 expression correlated with increased expression of both IL-1 and IL-6. Furthermore, IL-1 together with IL-6 or the IL-6 family cytokine, oncostatin M, synergistically upregulated YKL-40 expression in both primary human and mouse astrocytes in vitro. The robust cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes required both STAT3 and NF-kB binding elements of the YKL-40 promoter. In addition, YKL-40 expression was enhanced by constitutively active STAT3 and inhibited by dominant-negative IkBalpha. Surprisingly, cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes was independent of the p65 subunit of NF-kB and instead required subunits RelB and p50. Mechanistically, we show that IL-1-induced RelB/p50 complex formation was further promoted by oncostatin M and that these complexes directly bound to the YKL-40 promoter. Moreover, we found that expression of RelB was strongly upregulated during inflammation in vivo and by IL-1 in astrocytes in vitro. We propose that IL-1 and the IL-6 family of cytokines regulate YKL-40 expression during sterile inflammation via both STAT3 and RelB/p50 complexes. These results suggest that IL-1 may regulate the expression of specific anti-inflammatory genes in nonlymphoid tissues via the canonical activation of the RelB/p50 complexes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Epidemiological studies, indicating that non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the risk of developing AD, have encouraged the study on the role of inflammation in AD. The best- characterized action of most NSAIDs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). The expression of the constitutively expressed COX-1 and the inflammatory induced COX-2 has been intensively investigated in AD brain and different disease models for AD. Despite these studies, clinical trials with NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors showed little or no effect on clinical progression of AD. The expression levels of COX-1 and COX-2 change in the different stages of AD pathology. In an early stage, when low-fibrillar Abeta deposits are present and only very few neurofibrillary tangles are observed in the cortical areas, COX-2 is increased in neurons. The increased neuronal COX-2 expression parallels and colocalizes with the expression of cell cycle proteins. COX-1 is primarily expressed in microglia, which are associated with fibrillar Abeta deposits. This suggests that in AD brain COX-1 and COX-2 are involved in inflammatory and regenerating pathways respectively. In this review we will discuss the role of COX-1 and COX-2 in the different stages of AD pathology.

We then used this gene expression profile to examine two mouse models of AD, the APPsw (Tg-2576) and Tg-SwDI, models for amyloid deposition and for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) respectively. AGI, MRC1 and YM1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the Tg-2576 mouse brains compared to age-matched controls while TNFalpha and NOS2 mRNA levels, genes commonly associated with classical activation, increased or did not change, respectively. Only TNFalpha mRNA increased in the Tg-SwDI mouse brain. Alternative activation genes were also identified in brain samples from individuals with AD and were compared to age-matched control individuals. In AD brain, mRNAs for TNFalpha, AGI, MRC1 and the chitinase-3 like 1 and 2 genes (CHI3L1; CHI3L2) were significantly increased while NOS2 and IL-1beta mRNAs were unchanged.

The results suggest that miRNA-125b up-regulation contributes to astrogliosis and to defects in the cell cycle that are characteristic of degenerating brain tissues.

We then used this gene expression profile to examine two mouse models of AD, the APPsw (Tg-2576) and Tg-SwDI, models for amyloid deposition and for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) respectively. AGI, MRC1 and YM1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the Tg-2576 mouse brains compared to age-matched controls while TNFalpha and NOS2 mRNA levels, genes commonly associated with classical activation, increased or did not change, respectively. Only TNFalpha mRNA increased in the Tg-SwDI mouse brain. Alternative activation genes were also identified in brain samples from individuals with AD and were compared to age-matched control individuals.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) are type I integral membrane proteins currently composed of 10 members. LDLR possesses a wide array of ligands with different functions from cellular cholesterol uptake in the liver to cell specification and neuronal positioning during embryogenesis. ApoE, complexed in HDL and VLDL, is the major ligand for these receptors, and, being the e4 allele of APOE gene, the most relevant risk for the development of late-onset AD, several studies support a role for these receptors in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between ApoE alleles and AD development have not yet been completely elucidated, ApoE, along with its receptor-LDLR and LDL-receptors related protein (LRP), was reported to modulate Abeta production and clearance.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Upon binding, LRP8 transduces reelin signaling during neuronal development, and recent evidence has indicated that it interacts with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor, being involved in neuronal functions such as maturation of NMDA receptor composition in the hippocampus, and the regulation of long-term potentiation. Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Mitochondrial cyclophilin D: Once inside the mitochondria, Aï¿½ is able to interact with a number of targets, including the mitochondrial proteins ABAD and cyclophilin-D (CypD). Opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to depolarize mitochondria and release cytochrome C may be central to mitochondrial and neuronal malfunction in AD patients. CypD, an integral part of the MPTP, whose opening leads to cell death, interacts with Aï¿½ peptide within the mitochondria of AD patients and a Tg mouse model of AD. MPTP causes mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, release of cell death mediators and enhances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Computer simulation studies show that Aï¿½ interacts with both ANT and CypD. CypD/Aï¿½ interaction causes an oxidative stress and increased MPTP opening that triggers neurodegeneration. CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Aï¿½- and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and MPTP opening. Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a transport protein for ADP and ATP and component of MPTP that binds directly to CypD. This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death.

The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Aï¿½- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We show that miRNAs belonging to the miR-20a family (that is, miR-20a, miR-17-5p and miR-106b) could regulate APP expression in vitro and at the endogenous level in neuronal cell lines. A tight correlation between these miRNAs and APP was found during brain development and in differentiating neurons. We thus identify miRNAs as novel endogenous regulators of APP expression, suggesting that variations in miRNA expression could contribute to changes in APP expression in the brain during development and disease. This possibility is further corroborated by the observation that a statistically significant decrease in miR-106b expression was found in sporadic AD patients.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Inheritance of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the only confirmed and consistently replicated risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE is also a key ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), a major neuronal low-density lipoprotein receptor. ApoE and LRP mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the postmortem inferior temporal gyrus (area 20) and the hippocampus from individuals with dementia compared with those with intact cognition. In addition to their strong association with the progression of cognitive dysfunction, LRP and ApoE mRNA levels were also positively correlated with increasing neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Additionally, Western blot analysis of ApoE protein expression in the hippocampus showed that the differential expression observed at the transcriptional level is also reflected at the protein level. Given the critical role played by LRP and ApoE in amyloid beta (Abeta) and cholesterol trafficking, increased expression of LRP and ApoE may not only disrupt cholesterol homeostasis but may also contribute to some of the neurobiological features of AD, including plaque deposition.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abnormal regulation of tau phosphorylation and/or alternative splicing is associated with the development of a large (>20) group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer's disease. Despite intensive research, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that participate in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of endogenous tau, especially in neurons. We identified miR-16 and miR-132 as putative endogenous modulators of neuronal tau phosphorylation and tau exon 10 splicing, respectively. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been implicated in cell survival and function, whereas changes in miR-16/132 levels correlate with tau pathology in human neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, understanding how miRNA networks influence tau metabolism and possibly other biological systems might provide important clues into the molecular causes of tauopathies, particularly the more common but less understood sporadic forms.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In response to inflammatory stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) have a remarkable pattern of differentiation (maturation) that exhibits specific mechanisms to control immunity. Here, we show that in response to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), several microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Among these miRNAs, miR-155 is highly up-regulated during maturation. Using LNA silencing combined to microarray technology, we have identified the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 (TLR/IL-1) inflammatory pathway as a general target of miR-155. We further demonstrate that miR-155 directly controls the level of TAB2, an important signal transduction molecule. Our observations suggest, therefore, that in mature human DCs, miR-155 is part of a negative feedback loop, which down-modulates inflammatory cytokine production in response to microbial stimuli.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including tumor metastasis and Alzheimer's disease. However, mechanisms that regulate LRP1 expression under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are not unclear. In human cell lines, we found that miR-205 down-regulates the expression of LRP1 by targeting sequences in the 3'UTR of LRP1 mRNA. This effect was abolished by deleting the miR-205 seed site in the 3'UTR of LRP1. The ectopic expression of miR-205 also significantly mitigated migration of both U87 and SK-LU-1 cells. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that expression of human LRP1 is regulated in part by a specific miRNA, leading to decreased tumor cell migration.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Cellular uptake and degradation by glial cells is one means by which ABeta¸ may be cleared from the brain. In the current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation of ABeta¸ by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABeta¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABeta¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABeta¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABeta¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABeta¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that ABeta¸ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting an interaction between LDLR and ABeta¸ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated ABeta¸ uptake. Therefore, these results identify LDLR as a receptor that mediates ABeta¸ uptake and clearance by astrocytes, and provide evidence that increasing glial LDLR levels may promote ABeta¸ degradation within the brain	APOE	LDLR	Holtzman DM	"p(HGNC:""APOE"")"	22383525.0	association	"p(HGNC:""LDLR"")"	Low-density lipoprotein receptor represents an apolipoprotein E-independent pathway of Aβ uptake and degradation by astrocytes.
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	ABeta¸ directly interacts with Ca2+ channels such as voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) and TRP cation channels (TRPC) to produce a transient increase in Ca2+ necessary for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol- response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR- inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism.

The KANSL1 protein is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of the chromatin modifier KAT8, which influences gene expression through histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation. RNA sequencing studies in cell lines derived from affected individuals and the presence of learning deficits in Drosophila melanogaster mutants suggest a role for KANSL1 in neuronal processes.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	KANSL1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating MOF acetyltransferase activity on nucleosome H4. Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes, both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development, differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras.

Opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to depolarize mitochondria and release cytochrome C may be central to mitochondrial and neuronal malfunction in AD patients. CypD, an integral part of the MPTP, whose opening leads to cell death, interacts with Aï¿½ peptide within the mitochondria of AD patients and a Tg mouse model of AD. MPTP causes mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, release of cell death mediators and enhances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Computer simulation studies show that Aï¿½ interacts with both ANT and CypD. CypD/Aï¿½ interaction causes an oxidative stress and increased MPTP opening that triggers neurodegeneration. CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Aï¿½- and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and MPTP opening. Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a transport protein for ADP and ATP and component of MPTP that binds directly to CypD. This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death. Interestingly, the MPTP also requires the participation of members of the Bcl-2 family proteins but a clear understanding of the interaction of Aï¿½ with CypD together with both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in AD has not been made. The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Aï¿½- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Aberrant microRNA expression in the brains of neurodegenerative diseases: miR-29a decreased in Alzheimer disease brains targets neurone navigator 3. However, we found significant down-regulation of miR-29a in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. The database search on TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase Target identified neurone navigator 3 (NAV3), a regulator of axon guidance, as a principal target of miR-29a, and actually NAV3 mRNA levels were elevated in AD brains. MiR-29a-mediated down-regulation of NAV3 was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. By immunohistochemistry, NAV3 expression was most evidently enhanced in degenerating pyramidal neurones in the cerebral cortex of AD. These observations suggest the hypothesis that underexpression of miR-29a affects neurodegenerative processes by enhancing neuronal NAV3 expression in AD brains.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Abnormal regulation of tau phosphorylation and/or alternative splicing is associated with the development of a large (>20) group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer's disease. Despite intensive research, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that participate in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of endogenous tau, especially in neurons. We identified miR-16 and miR-132 as putative endogenous modulators of neuronal tau phosphorylation and tau exon 10 splicing, respectively. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been implicated in cell survival and function, whereas changes in miR-16/132 levels correlate with tau pathology in human neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, understanding how miRNA networks influence tau metabolism and possibly other biological systems might provide important clues into the molecular causes of tauopathies, particularly the more common but less understood sporadic forms.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In response to inflammatory stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) have a remarkable pattern of differentiation (maturation) that exhibits specific mechanisms to control immunity. Here, we show that in response to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), several microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Among these miRNAs, miR-155 is highly up-regulated during maturation. Using LNA silencing combined to microarray technology, we have identified the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 (TLR/IL-1) inflammatory pathway as a general target of miR-155. We further demonstrate that miR-155 directly controls the level of TAB2, an important signal transduction molecule. Our observations suggest, therefore, that in mature human DCs, miR-155 is part of a negative feedback loop, which down-modulates inflammatory cytokine production in response to microbial stimuli.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Reverse signaling through the ephrinB ligands is important for several morphogenetic events, such as axon guidance, neuronal plasticity, spine maturation, and synaptogenesis. Signaling is initiated by binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation via an unclear mechanism. Here we show that this mechanism involves presenilin1 (PS1)/gamma-secretase regulation of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk binding protein (PAG/Cbp), an adaptor protein that controls the activity of Src kinases.Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot of mouse primary neuronal and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell extracts overexpressing PAG/Cbp, we show that EphB2 induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp in a gamma-secretase- dependent manner. In these cells, PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation is promoted by the PS1/gamma-secretase-produced fragment of ephrinB2 cleavage (ephrinB2/CTF2), which forms complexes with PAG/Cbp when introduced exogenously. EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB2 depends on PAG/Cbp because EphB2 cannot increase ephrinB2 phosphorylation in cells treated with anti-PAG siRNA or in PAG/Cbp- knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, in contrast to WT PS1, familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) PS1 mutants expressed in PS1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibited both the EphB2-induced dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and the phosphorylation of ephrinB2. PS1 FAD mutations may thus inhibit the function of ephrinB in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The extracellular domain of APP interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein F-spondin. F-spondin also interacts with members of the LDL receptor family.Reelin is another large, multi-domain, extracellular protein that interacts with members of the LDL receptor family.Reelin affects neurite outgrowth in vitro and regulates neuronal migration in development via phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Disabled (Dab-1). Dab-1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of the proteins in the LDL receptor and APP families.Another important class of molecules involved in neurite outgrowth, cell adhesion, and cell migration is the family of integrins.Integrins are transmembrane proteins that form the link between the ECM and intracellular components. APP interacts and colocalizes with ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin, a molecule that is important for proper laminar organization and capable of enhancing neurite outgrowth. ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin interacts with Reelin, and this interaction is important for its effects on neuronal migration.we observed that interactions between Reelin, APP, and a3ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin promote neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons and that APP and Reelin affected dendritic processes in vivo.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol- response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR- inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism.

The physiological role of these binding interactions remains to be elucidated. Best studied are the Cu(II)- and Zn(II)-binding activities of APP. The Zn(II) binding is assumed to play mainly a structural role (Bush et al., 1993), whereas APP is able to catalyse a reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I)	GPC4	APP	Annaert W	"p(HGNC:""GPC4"")"	10806097.0	association	"p(HGNC:""APP"")"	Proteolytic processing and cell biological functions of the amyloid precursor protein.

BuChE genotype was linked with differential CSF levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100B, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. BCHE-K noncarriers displayed 100%-150% higher glial fibrillary acidic protein and 64%-110% higher S100B than BCHE-K carriers, who, in contrast, had 40%-80% higher interleukin-1beta and 21%-27% higher TNF- alpha compared with noncarriers. A high level of CSF BuChE enzymatic phenotype also significantly correlated with higher CSF levels of astroglial markers and several factors of the innate complement system, but lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Sortilin receptor 1 (SORL1) is involved in cellular trafficking of amyloid precursor protein and plays an essential role in amyloid-beta peptide generation in Alzheimer disease (AD). The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Another relevant role for PSs is Notch processing. Notch signaling is involved in cell fate regulation, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis as well as neurodegeneration. Notch is a membrane receptor whose C-terminal domain (NICD), upon interaction with appropriate ligands, translocates into the nucleus where it activates the CSL family of transcription factors. NICD formation depends on gamma-secretase complex as the AICD fragment of AbetaPP. PSs play a role in apoptotic process, since FAD mutants cause cell death or induce secondary events that may lead to apoptotic process .Animals, in which PS1 and PS2 genes are deleted, show deficit in learning, memory, synaptic function and neuronal death. The processes beneath these effects are unknown, but the findings that PS1 interacts with antiapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family might indicate a possible mechanism.

ApoE, complexed in HDL and VLDL, is the major ligand for these receptors, and, being the e4 allele of APOE gene, the most relevant risk for the development of late-onset AD, several studies support a role for these receptors in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between ApoE alleles and AD development have not yet been completely elucidated, ApoE, along with its receptor-LDLR and LDL-receptors related protein (LRP), was reported to modulate Abeta production and clearance.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Upon binding, LRP8 transduces reelin signaling during neuronal development, and recent evidence has indicated that it interacts with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor, being involved in neuronal functions such as maturation of NMDA receptor composition in the hippocampus, and the regulation of long-term potentiation. Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Mitochondrial cyclophilin D: Once inside the mitochondria, Aï¿½ is able to interact with a number of targets, including the mitochondrial proteins ABAD and cyclophilin-D (CypD). Opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to depolarize mitochondria and release cytochrome C may be central to mitochondrial and neuronal malfunction in AD patients. CypD, an integral part of the MPTP, whose opening leads to cell death, interacts with Aï¿½ peptide within the mitochondria of AD patients and a Tg mouse model of AD. MPTP causes mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, release of cell death mediators and enhances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Computer simulation studies show that Aï¿½ interacts with both ANT and CypD. CypD/Aï¿½ interaction causes an oxidative stress and increased MPTP opening that triggers neurodegeneration. CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Aï¿½- and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and MPTP opening. Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a transport protein for ADP and ATP and component of MPTP that binds directly to CypD. This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death. Interestingly, the MPTP also requires the participation of members of the Bcl-2 family proteins but a clear understanding of the interaction of Aï¿½ with CypD together with both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in AD has not been made. The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Aï¿½- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD. Together these studies provide new mechanisms for Aï¿½ targets that link the MPTP to synaptic stress and the neurodegeneration seen in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Amyloid is a term used to describe typically extracellular deposits of aggregated proteins, sometimes known as plaques. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid is Amyloidosis, a term associated with diseased organs and tissues, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-Beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008). An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.

According to these findings, hnRNP-A1 and its transcription regulatory factor miR-590-3p are disregulated in patients with AD, and the hnRNP-A1 rs7967622 C/C genotype is likely a risk factor for FTLD in male populations.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The oxidized LDL receptor 1 gene (OLR1) rs1050283 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been previously shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An association analysis of OLR1 was carried out in a population of 443 patients with AD as compared with 393 age- matched controls. In addition, an expression analysis of OLR1 and its regulatory hsa-miR369-3p was performed in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from 20 patients and 15 controls. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for gender and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, showed a statistically significant association of OLR1 rs1050283 under the assumption of a dominant model (CC and CT individuals versus TT: p = 0.014, OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.08-2.08) and a genotypic model (TC versus TT: p = 0.002, OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.14-2.26). No significant differences in OLR1 expression was observed between patients and controls (p > 0.05). However, stratifying patients according to the rs1050283 status, significantly decreased relative PBMC expression levels of OLR1 were observed in carriers of CC+CT genotypes as compared with TT carriers (0.13 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â± 0.013 versus 0.46 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 0.028, p = 0.022), whereas no differences in relative expression levels of the hsa-miR369-3p were observed (p > 0.05). The effect observed was not due to the presence of the ApoE ε4 allele. The OLR1 rs1050283 SNP likely acts as a risk factor for sporadic AD. The presence of at least one C allele is associated with a decreased expression of OLR1 mRNA in the absence of hsa-miR369-3p de-regulation, suggesting that the presence of the polymorphic allele influences the binding of hsa- miR369-3p to its 3'UTR consensus sequence. Nevertheless, the limited power of the study requires further investigations with a larger sample size.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In response to inflammatory stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) have a remarkable pattern of differentiation (maturation) that exhibits specific mechanisms to control immunity. Here, we show that in response to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), several microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Among these miRNAs, miR-155 is highly up-regulated during maturation. Using LNA silencing combined to microarray technology, we have identified the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 (TLR/IL-1) inflammatory pathway as a general target of miR-155. We further demonstrate that miR-155 directly controls the level of TAB2, an important signal transduction molecule. Our observations suggest, therefore, that in mature human DCs, miR-155 is part of a negative feedback loop, which down-modulates inflammatory cytokine production in response to microbial stimuli.

BuChE genotype was linked with differential CSF levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100B, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. BCHE-K noncarriers displayed 100%-150% higher glial fibrillary acidic protein and 64%-110% higher S100B than BCHE-K carriers, who, in contrast, had 40%-80% higher interleukin-1beta and 21%-27% higher TNF- alpha compared with noncarriers. A high level of CSF BuChE enzymatic phenotype also significantly correlated with higher CSF levels of astroglial markers and several factors of the innate complement system, but lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

In temporal cortex, ACT and APOE staining was localized to plaque-like profiles, reactive astrocytes, and blood vessels; human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining revealed focal clusters of reactive microglia and astrocytes. In cerebellum, ACT and APOE immunoreactivity was never localized to plaque-like profiles but was weakly localized to unreactive astrocytes; weak HLA-DR and GFAP immunoreactivity was present on quiescent microglia throughout the cerebellum.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) are type I integral membrane proteins currently composed of 10 members. LDLR possesses a wide array of ligands with different functions from cellular cholesterol uptake in the liver to cell specification and neuronal positioning during embryogenesis. ApoE, complexed in HDL and VLDL, is the major ligand for these receptors, and, being the e4 allele of APOE gene, the most relevant risk for the development of late-onset AD, several studies support a role for these receptors in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between ApoE alleles and AD development have not yet been completely elucidated, ApoE, along with its receptor-LDLR and LDL-receptors related protein (LRP), was reported to modulate Abeta production and clearance.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Upon binding, LRP8 transduces reelin signaling during neuronal development, and recent evidence has indicated that it interacts with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor, being involved in neuronal functions such as maturation of NMDA receptor composition in the hippocampus, and the regulation of long-term potentiation. Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Reverse signaling through the ephrinB ligands is important for several morphogenetic events, such as axon guidance, neuronal plasticity, spine maturation, and synaptogenesis. Signaling is initiated by binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation via an unclear mechanism. Here we show that this mechanism involves presenilin1 (PS1)/gamma-secretase regulation of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk binding protein (PAG/Cbp), an adaptor protein that controls the activity of Src kinases.Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot of mouse primary neuronal and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell extracts overexpressing PAG/Cbp, we show that EphB2 induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp in a gamma-secretase- dependent manner. In these cells, PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation is promoted by the PS1/gamma-secretase-produced fragment of ephrinB2 cleavage (ephrinB2/CTF2), which forms complexes with PAG/Cbp when introduced exogenously. EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB2 depends on PAG/Cbp because EphB2 cannot increase ephrinB2 phosphorylation in cells treated with anti-PAG siRNA or in PAG/Cbp- knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, in contrast to WT PS1, familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) PS1 mutants expressed in PS1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibited both the EphB2-induced dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and the phosphorylation of ephrinB2. PS1 FAD mutations may thus inhibit the function of ephrinB in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Mitochondrial cyclophilin D: Once inside the mitochondria, Aï¿½ is able to interact with a number of targets, including the mitochondrial proteins ABAD and cyclophilin-D (CypD). Opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to depolarize mitochondria and release cytochrome C may be central to mitochondrial and neuronal malfunction in AD patients. CypD, an integral part of the MPTP, whose opening leads to cell death, interacts with Aï¿½ peptide within the mitochondria of AD patients and a Tg mouse model of AD. MPTP causes mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, release of cell death mediators and enhances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Computer simulation studies show that Aï¿½ interacts with both ANT and CypD. CypD/Aï¿½ interaction causes an oxidative stress and increased MPTP opening that triggers neurodegeneration. CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Aï¿½- and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and MPTP opening. Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a transport protein for ADP and ATP and component of MPTP that binds directly to CypD. This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death. Interestingly, the MPTP also requires the participation of members of the Bcl-2 family proteins but a clear understanding of the interaction of Aï¿½ with CypD together with both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in AD has not been made. The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Aï¿½- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD. Together these studies provide new mechanisms for Aï¿½ targets that link the MPTP to synaptic stress and the neurodegeneration seen in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Granulin (GRN, or progranulin) is a protein involved in wound repair, inflammation, and neoplasia. GRN has also been directly implicated in frontotemporal dementia and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, GRN regulation expression is poorly understood. A high-throughput experimental microRNA assay showed that GRN is the strongest target for miR-107 in human H4 neuroglioma cells. miR-107 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and sequence elements in the open reading frame-rather than the 3' untranslated region-of GRN mRNA are recognized by miR-107 and are highly conserved among vertebrate species. To better understand the mechanism of this interaction, FLAG-tagged Argonaute constructs were used following miR-107 transfection. GRN mRNA interacts preferentially with Argonaute 2. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that regulation of GRN by miR-107 may be functionally important. Glucose supplementation in cultured cells that leads to increased miR-107 levels also results in decreased GRN expression, including changes in cell compartmentation and decreased secretion of GRN protein. This effect was eliminated following miR-107 transfection. We also tested a mouse model where miR-107 has been shown to be down-regulated.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Using a bioinformatics screen to identify sequence motifs enriched in the 3'UTR of rapidly destabilized mRNAs, we identified a developmentally and activity-regulated miRNA (miR-485) that controls dendritic spine number and synapse formation in an activity-dependent homeostatic manner. We find that many plasticity-associated genes contain predicted miR-485 binding sites and further identify the presynaptic protein SV2A as a target of miR-485. miR-485 negatively regulated dendritic spine density, postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) clustering, and surface expression of GluR2. Furthermore, miR-485 overexpression reduced spontaneous synaptic responses and transmitter release, as measured by miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) analysis and FM 1-43 staining. SV2A knockdown mimicked the effects of miR-485, and these effects were reversed by SV2A overexpression. Moreover, 5 d of increased synaptic activity induced homeostatic changes in synaptic specializations that were blocked by a miR-485 inhibitor. Our findings reveal a role for this previously uncharacterized miRNA and the presynaptic protein SV2A in homeostatic plasticity and nervous system development, with possible implications in neurological disorders (e.g., Huntington and Alzheimer's disease), where miR-485 has been found to be dysregulated.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Recently, there have been increasing evidences that microRNA-146 (miR-146) is related to up-regulated immune and inflammatory signaling through its target genes, such as IRAK1 and TRAF6. Additionally, abundant data continue to support the hypothesis that progressive up- regulation of inflammatory gene expression and elevated inflammatory signaling facilitate the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review focuses on the recent findings regarding the role of miR-146 in modulating immune response and its subsequent effects in the pathogenesis of AD.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	In response to inflammatory stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) have a remarkable pattern of differentiation (maturation) that exhibits specific mechanisms to control immunity. Here, we show that in response to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), several microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Among these miRNAs, miR-155 is highly up-regulated during maturation. Using LNA silencing combined to microarray technology, we have identified the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 (TLR/IL-1) inflammatory pathway as a general target of miR-155. We further demonstrate that miR-155 directly controls the level of TAB2, an important signal transduction molecule. Our observations suggest, therefore, that in mature human DCs, miR-155 is part of a negative feedback loop, which down-modulates inflammatory cytokine production in response to microbial stimuli.

F-spondin also interacts with members of the LDL receptor family.Reelin is another large, multi-domain, extracellular protein that interacts with members of the LDL receptor family.Reelin affects neurite outgrowth in vitro and regulates neuronal migration in development via phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Disabled (Dab-1).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	We have previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase-inducible degrader of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Idol) as a post-translational modulator of LDLR levels. Idol is a direct target for regulation by liver X receptors (LXRs), and its expression is responsive to cellular sterol status independent of the sterol- response element-binding proteins. Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR- inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	KANSL1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating MOF acetyltransferase activity on nucleosome H4. Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes, both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development, differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras. This mechanism could explain the overlapping phenotypic features observed in the KANSL1 haploinsufficiency phenotype and the RASopathies. Additional clinical and experimental studies will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis and further understand the molecular mechanisms associated with deleterious KANSL1 alleles.

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	The scaffolding protein Axin uses separate domains to interact with GSK3, CK1α, and β-catenin and coordinates sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin at serine 45 by CK1α and then at threonine 41, serine 37 and serine 33 by GSK3 (Kimelman and Xu, 2006). β-catenin phosphorylation at serine 33 and 37 creates a binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-Trcp, leading to β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation	CTNNB1	AXIN1	He X	"p(HGNC:""CTNNB1"",pmod(Ph,S,33))"	19619488.0	association	"p(HGNC:""AXIN1"")"	Wnt/beta-catenin signaling: components, mechanisms, and diseases.
Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Here, we describe a direct interaction between LRRK2 and β-tubulin. This interaction is conferred by the LRRK2 Roc domain and is disrupted by the familial R1441G mutation and artificial Roc domain mutations that mimic autophosphorylation. LRRK2 selectively interacts with three β-tubulin isoforms: TUBB, TUBB4, and TUBB6, one of which (TUBB4) is mutated in the movement disorder dystonia type 4 (DYT4).

Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Assembly	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.
